Further significant judgement is \napplied in determining slow moving inventory, using historic \nsales data to estimate the likelihood of future obsolescence. \nUnderstanding the rationale for, obtaining evidence for, and \nassessing the completeness of the various manual adjustments \nrequired significant auditor attention given the degree of \njudgement involved. \nSupplier rebates \nIn acquiring inventory, the Group enters into contractual \nagreements with suppliers through which it is entitled to receive \nvarious cost rebates, including volume-based rebates, \nadvertising recoupments and other discounts linked to the \npurchase of inventory. The variety of contractual terms, and \namount of rebates earned, is significant and a portion of this \nincome is recognised as a reduction to the cost of inventory. \nSignificant judgement is applied in determining the probability \nand amount of volume-related allowances involving contractual \ntarget volumes, as well as in the calculation used to recognise a \nproportion of rebates as a reduction in the cost of inventory. \nDue to the judgements applied by management in the \ncalculation of adjustments to inventory at"

Extension options are generally exercised six to 12 months before the end of the lease \nterm. When the lease term is adjusted as a result of exercising an extension option not included in the initial measurement \nof the lease liability, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset. The assessment of \nreasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the control \nof the lessee occurs and affects this assessment. \n(h)\t\u0007\nDiscount rate used to calculate the lease liability: Incremental borrowing rates used to calculate lease liabilities at \ninception of the lease are determined monthly and depend on the term, country, currency and start date of the lease. The \nincremental borrowing rate is determined based on a series of inputs including: the risk-free rate based on government \nbond rates; a country-specific risk adjustment; an adjustment for the term of the lease; and an entity-specific adjustment \nwhere the entity risk profile is different to that of the Group.\n(i)\t \u0007\nDetermination of whether a sale and leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale: A sale and leaseback is a transaction \nin which the owner of an asset sells the asset and leases it back from the buyer.

Refer to notes 3, 5, 7, 27 and 46.\n(d)\t\u0007\nIncome taxes: The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in \ndetermining the worldwide accrual for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated uncertain income tax \npositions for either the most likely amount or the expected value (probability weighted average), based on management’s \nestimates of potential additional taxes due. For the period under review, the Group primarily applied the most likely \namount method to calculate the best estimate of potential cash outflows as management expects this method to better \npredict the resolution of the uncertainties. Management apply judgement to estimate the reasonable likelihood \npercentages using the Group’s experiences of historic successful reductions in similar tax matters, taking into \nconsideration advice from independent experts regarding the merits of each d"

Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the \nrights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and \ndetermined them to be joint ventures. The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method \nand are initially recognised at cost. \nThe Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive \nincome are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and in other comprehensive income respectively, with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment, from the date that joint control commences until the \ndate that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the \njoint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made \npayments on behalf of the joint venture. When necessary, accounting policies applied by joint ventures have been changed \nto ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n1.3\t \t\nCell captive insurance arrangements\nThe Group has entered into insurance cell arrangements with Old Mutual Life Insurance Company (Namibia) Ltd and \nCentriq Insurance Company Ltd, licensed insurance companies.

All property, plant and equipment are \nstated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. The historical cost includes all \nexpenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the buildings, machinery, equipment and vehicles and is \ndepreciated on a straight-line basis, from the date it is available for use, at rates appropriate to the various classes of assets \ninvolved, taking into account the estimated useful life and residual values of the individual items. Land is not depreciated, as \nit has an unlimited useful life. Improvements to leasehold properties are shown at cost and written off over the shorter of the \nremaining period of the lease and the items’ useful life.\nManagement determines the estimated useful lives, residual values and the related depreciation charges at acquisition and \nthese are reviewed at each reporting date. If appropriate, adjustments are made and accounted for prospectively as a \nchange in estimate. During the year, the estimated useful life of racking has been adjusted to 20 years (previously 15 years) \nand shelving has been adjusted to 10 years (previously 6 years).

An \nabandoned operation is classified as a discontinued operation when it has been closed. The results of discontinued \noperations are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n1.11\t \t\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill and customer relationships, being the Group’s only non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life, is not subject \nto depreciation and amortisation and is tested for impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes \nin circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Other assets that are subject to depreciation and amortisation are \nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be \nrecoverable. The determination of whether an asset is impaired requires significant management judgement and the following \nfactors, amongst others, will be considered: duration and extent to which the fair value of the assets is less than its cost; \nindustry, geographical and sector performance; changes in regional economies; and operational and financing cash flows.\nWhere the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is impaired and the \nasset is written down to i"

The net investment in lease receivables is measured as the present \nvalue of the lease payments to be received over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the \ninterest rate implicit in the sublease cannot be readily determined, the discount rate for the head lease is used. Any \ndifference between the right-of-use asset and net investment in lease receivables is recognised in profit or loss. \nThe lease liabilities of the head leases are accounted for in terms of note 1.12.1.\nNet investment in lease receivables is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. \nLease payments received are allocated between principal and finance income.

All other rental income is recognised as it becomes due.

Where the coverage period is one year or less the insurance \nacquisition cash flows are expensed. For contracts with a coverage period of more than one year the insurance \nacquisition cash flows are capitalised and then amortised. The carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage is \nmeasured as:\n•\t The sum of all capital contributions received; \n•\t Less insurance acquisition expenses; \n•\t Less dividends paid by the cell; and\n•\t Plus insurance revenue recognised in respect of services provided during the reporting period.\n\t\n\u0007\nThe liabilities "

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify risks faced by \nthe Group and establish appropriate controls and limits to mitigate the risk to acceptable levels. The Audit and Risk \nCommittee oversees how management monitors compliance with these risk and control policies.\nThis note discloses information about the Group’s capital risk management and exposure to risks from its use of financial \ninstruments. It also discloses information about the Group’s exposure to insurance risk and how it is mitigated.\n43.1\nCapital risk management\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order \nto provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to \nreduce the cost of capital. Total capital is considered to be equity as shown in the statement of financial position.\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, \nreturn capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The gearing ratio is calculated as interest-\nbearing borrowings and lease liabilities divided by equity and was 179.3% (2024: 167.6%) at the reporting date.\nThe Group is currently maintaining a 1.75 times (2024: 1.75 times) dividend cover based on diluted headline earnings per \nshare from continuing operations.\n43.2\nFair value of financial instruments\nAll financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy tha"

The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of \nfinancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group \nuses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange rate contracts and price swap contracts as economic \nhedges, to hedge certain exposures. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied, using non-derivative \nfinancial instruments, to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of \nDirectors. The treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s \noperating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering \nspecific areas, such as foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and \ninvesting excess liquidity.\n43.4.1\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual \nobligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual \ncharacteristics of each counterparty. Potential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of investment in insurance cell \ncaptive arrangements, government bonds and bills, loans receiva"

This is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired assets.\nWith regard to credit-impaired accounts, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the \namortised cost, i.e. gross carrying amount less impairment provision, resulting in lower interest revenue.\nThe criteria for credit-impaired accounts (i.e. when the account moves to stage 3 as a result of loss events that have \noccurred after initial recognition) are as follows:\nReceivables arising from contracts with customers:\n•\t In duplum (the National Credit Act section providing that all charges ceases to accrue once the sum of the charges \nequals the amount of capital outstanding at the time);\n•\t Debt counselling accounts (as governed by the National Credit Act);\n•\t Non-performing accounts; and\n•\t As a backstop, accounts not included in the above categories, where no payment has been received over the last three \nconsecutive months.\nGovernment bonds and bills and loans receivable:\n•\t Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;\n•\t Where a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations; and\n•\t The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.\nOther receivables:\nWhere a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations for three consecutive months.\nCuring\nA credit-impaired account will cure when the customer does not meet the criteria for being a credit-impaired a"

The key \naspect of the arrear calculation is the Group’s policy not to reschedule arrears nor to amend the terms of the original \ncontract.\nFrom the onset of the agreement, contractual arrears are calculated by comparing payments made life to date with the \noriginally calculated instalments due life to date, causing a customer who is paying less than the required contracted \ninstalment to immediately fall into arrears. Once the customer exceeds the term of the agreement by paying less than the \nrequired contracted instalments, the full balance owing will be in arrears. The Group does not consider arrears the \nleading indicator, but rather payment ratings for the reasons mentioned above.\nThe tables below reflect the maximum exposure to credit risk on instalment sale receivables as well as the ECL allowance \nand contractual arrears per customer grouping at the reporting date. Customer groupings are determined as follows:\n•\t Satisfactory paid: Customers who have paid 70% or more of amounts due over the contract period.\n•\t Slow payers: Customers who have paid 55% to 69% of amounts due over the contract period.\n•\t Non-performing accounts: Customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period.\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 29 June 2025\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nCustomer grouping\nTotal \nnumber of \ncustomers\nGross \ncarrying \namount\nRm\nECL \nallow"

The transition matrix and payment performance for each payment state has been \ndeveloped utilising customer payment history. The transition matrix predicts the population’s payment behaviour and \nprobability of the account being in a particular payment state and transitioning into future payment states. The key states \nin the transitional matrix are the customer’s lifetime payment rating, age of the account and contractual term. The lifetime \npayment rating measures the customer’s actual payments received over the lifetime of the account relative to the \ncontractual instalments due.\nFor modelling purposes, cash flows are forecast on an individual customer level and aggregated over all the customer’s \nsub-accounts until the account is settled or written off.

These days are brought to account approximately every six years by including a 53rd week. \nAccordingly, the results for the financial year under review are for a 52-week period, ended 29 June 2025, compared to \n52 weeks in the previous financial year.\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Accounting \nStandards (IFRS® Accounting Standards) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and \nInterpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and comply with the SAICA Financial Reporting \nGuides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial \nReporting Standards Council (FRSC) and the requirements o"

The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to \nminimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of \nDirectors. The treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company’s \noperating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering \nspecific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and investing excess liquidity.\n14.3.1\nCredit risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the \nCompany. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. \nPotential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of amounts receivable from subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents \nand financial guarantee contracts.\nThe Company’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs, \nassumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) \nhas occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired.
