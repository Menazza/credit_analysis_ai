Other\nthan the matters disclosed in these financial statements, there have been no material events occurring between\n29 June 2025 and the date of authorisation of these financial statements on 1 October 2025, which would require adjustment\nto or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\n### 1.1 Basis of preparation\nThe Group reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which treats each financial year as an exact 52-week period,\nincorporating trade from Monday to Sunday each week. This treatment effectively results in the loss of a day (or two in a\nleap year) per calendar year. These days are brought to account approximately every six years by including a 53rd week.\nAccordingly, the results for the financial year under review are for a 52-week period, ended 29 June 2025, compared to\n52 weeks in the previous financial year.\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Accounting\nStandards (IFRS® Accounting Standards) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and\nInterpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and comply with the SAICA Financial Reporting\nGuides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial\nReporting Standards Council (FRSC), the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and the requirements of the South African\nCompanies Act, 71 of 2008. The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention adjusted for the\neffects of inflation, where entities operate in hyperinflationary economies, and for the revaluation of certain financial\ninstruments to fair value. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\nThe Ghana economy has been considered to be hyperinflationary. Accordingly, the results, cash flows and financial position\nof the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana have been expressed in terms of the measuring unit applicable at the reporting date.\nThe Angolan economy had been considered to be hyperinflationary up to 30 June 2019. For the 52 weeks ended\n29 June 2025, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be hyperinflationary. Although no further hyperinflationary\nadjustments were required for the current and comparative reporting period of the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, the\nstatement of financial position at the reporting date still includes cumulative hyperinflation adjustments as a result of the\napplication of IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, up to 30 June 2019. These cumulative\nhyperinflation adjustments, included in property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, are written off to the\nstatement of comprehensive income, together with the related deferred income tax effect, in accordance with the Group’s\naccounting policies for the respective items.\n\n### 1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates\n1.1.1.1 Judgements\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to exercise\nits judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The most significant judgements in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies relate to the following:\n(a) Investment in associate: The Group considers Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd to be a strategic partner and holds a\n49.9% shareholding in the associate. Significant judgement is required in determining whether or not the Group controls\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd. Management determined that control of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd vests in\nits Board of Directors. Equites Property Fund Ltd has a 50.1% shareholding in Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd and\nmay appoint the majority of Directors to the Board of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd. Furthermore, the majority stake\nsubstantive rights inferred includes the ability to appoint key management personnel, the ability to enter into significant\ntransactions and the ability to dominate the nomination of members to the Board of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\nThe founding and operational agreements of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd note that the Group has been\ngranted a number of protective rights and the scope of the activities of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd has\nbeen partially restricted. Equites Property Fund Ltd has substantive rights to direct these relevant activities of\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\nBased on the assessment done by management it was concluded that Equites Property Fund Ltd controls\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd and that the Group exercises significant influence over Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\n(b) Date of acquisition of Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd and Resilient Africa Managers (Pty) Ltd: During the previous financial\nyear, the Group acquired Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd and Resilient Africa Managers (Pty) Ltd. Significant judgement was\nrequired in determining the acquisition date on which the Group obtained control of the entities. The date of acquisition\nwas determined to be the date when the Group assumed the risks and rewards associated with the acquisition, being\nend of March 2024, when the share purchase agreements were signed and both parties unconditionally committed to the\ntransaction.\n22\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(c) Investment in joint venture: The Group previously held a 50% shareholding in Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd, the delivery\npartner for Sixty60 and acquired the remaining 50% share capital during the reporting period. Significant judgement was\nrequired in determining whether the Group controlled Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd. Management determined that control of\nPingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd vested in its Board of Directors. The Board- and sub-committee compositions were equally\nrepresented by the shareholders. These committees made decisions about the relevant activities and the appointment of\nkey management personnel of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\nThe founding and operational agreements of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd note that the Group had been granted a number of\nprotective rights and the scope of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd’s activities has been partially restricted. The shareholders\ntogether had substantive rights to direct the relevant activities of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\nFurther judgement was applied in considering whether the agreement was a joint venture or joint operation. According to\nprojections, Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd would not provide substantially all of its services solely to the Group.\nBased on the assessment done by management, it was concluded that the shareholders jointly controlled\nPingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd and therefore this was accounted for as a joint venture up to the date that the Group\nacquired the remaining share capital of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\n(d) Third-party cell captive contracts: Judgement was applied to determine the Group’s eligibility for adopting the premium\nallocation approach, in accordance with IFRS 17. The Group has adopted the premium allocation approach as it\nreasonably expects the measurement relating to its insurance contracts would not differ materially from that produced\nunder the general measurement model, if applied.\n(e) Investment in Shoprite Employee Trust: The Group established Shoprite Employee Trust on a non-vesting, evergreen\nbasis. Significant judgement is required in determining whether or not the Group controls Shoprite Employee Trust. As\nits founder, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd funded the Shoprite Employee Trust primarily on a notional basis upon formation\nof the trust. Aimed at retention and motivation of the Group’s employees in an appropriate manner and ensuring that\nthey benefit from the growth and continued success of the Group, the objective of the scheme implemented by\nShoprite Employee Trust is to provide eligible employees with distributions whenever a dividend is declared by\nShoprite Holdings Ltd to its ordinary shareholders. Such distributions to eligible employees are funded by dividends\nreceived from Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd.\nBased on the assessment done by management, it was concluded that the Group controls Shoprite Employee Trust in\naccordance with IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements, and that the appropriate accounting treatment for this\nentity is for the Group to consolidate its results.\n(f) Classification of cash and bank balances: Local currency cash and short-term deposits held in Angola, Nigeria and\nMalawi are subject to onerous local exchange control regulations, which provide restrictions on exporting capital from the\ncountry, other than through normal dividends. In order to determine how restricted funds should be classified in the cash\nflow statement, it should be considered whether the restricted funds meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents or\nwhether the funds are restricted in a manner such that the definition is not met. Significant judgement is required in this\nassessment. Management assessed the economic substance of the restrictions in each case by taking into consideration\nthe facts and circumstances of the specific restrictions and how management intends to use the deposits. It was\nconcluded that restricted funds that are available for use in the short-term in Angola, Nigeria and Malawi (2024: Angola,\nNigeria and Malawi), albeit with some restrictions over their use, still qualify to be classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nHowever, the deposit accounts in Angola which were held for objections to tax assessments were ring-fenced as they\ncould not be utilised by the Group. These guaranteed amounts were classified as restricted cash on the statement of\nfinancial position. The funds do not form part of the statement of cash flows as the Group does not have access to these\naccounts.\n(g) Lease term: In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic\nincentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after\ntermination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not\nterminated).\nFor leases of distribution centres and retail stores, the following factors are normally the most relevant:\n• The number of extension options included in the initial measurement of the lease liability will depend on the length of\nthe initial period and whether higher-than-normal capital expenditure was incurred on leasehold improvements. For\nsubsequent measurement, the store’s profitability is used to determine if and how many options are to be included\nupon renewal of the lease.\n• Otherwise, the Group considers other factors including the costs and business disruption required to replace the\nleased asset.\nMost extension options in rental contracts for offices and the commercial vehicle fleet have not been included in the lease\nliability, because the Group could replace the assets without significant cost or business disruption.\n23\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(g) Lease term: continued\nThe lease term is reassessed if an extension option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged\nto exercise (or not exercise) it. Extension options are generally exercised six to 12 months before the end of the lease\nterm. When the lease term is adjusted as a result of exercising an extension option not included in the initial measurement\nof the lease liability, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset. The assessment of\nreasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the control\nof the lessee occurs and affects this assessment.\n(h) Discount rate used to calculate the lease liability: Incremental borrowing rates used to calculate lease liabilities at\ninception of the lease are determined monthly and depend on the term, country, currency and start date of the lease. The\nincremental borrowing rate is determined based on a series of inputs including: the risk-free rate based on government\nbond rates; a country-specific risk adjustment; an adjustment for the term of the lease; and an entity-specific adjustment\nwhere the entity risk profile is different to that of the Group.\n(i) Determination of whether a sale and leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale: A sale and leaseback is a transaction\nin which the owner of an asset sells the asset and leases it back from the buyer. The IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) treatment\nof a sale and leaseback transaction hinges on whether the transaction is considered to be a sale or not. Where the Group\nacts as a seller-lessee in this transaction, it must determine if the transaction qualifies as a sale for which revenue is\nrecognised, or whether the transaction is a collateralised borrowing.\nThe assessment of whether the transaction is a sale depends on whether it satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15:\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), in which the buyer-lessor obtains control of the asset. Judgement is\nthus required in analysing whether the transaction constitutes a transfer of control sale in terms of IFRS 15.\nIn terms of IFRS 15, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset) to a\ncustomer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. In determining whether control\nhas transferred to the buyer-lessor, management considers all qualitative facts and prepares a quantitative assessment\nconsidering the proportion of the fair value retained.\n(j) Classification of non-current assets to be sold within 12 months after the reporting date: Management applies\njudgement in determining whether a portfolio of assets and related liabilities should be classified as held for sale. In terms\nof IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS 5), an entity shall classify a disposal\ngroup as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through\ncontinuing use.\nThe Group identified a portfolio of malls to be sold and subsequently leased back from the buyer-lessor (subject to\ncertain conditions). Management applied their judgement and concluded that the carrying amount of the malls would be\nrecovered principally through sale rather than through continued use as the Group retained an insignificant percentage of\nthe fair value of the underlying assets. The portfolio of malls was subsequently classified as assets held for sale as their\ncarrying amounts were recovered principally through a sale transaction.\nDuring the current year the Group signed agreements to dispose of the furniture business (excluding Mozambique), as\nwell as the Group’s operations in Ghana and Malawi. Furthermore an offer was accepted to sell the Group’s subsidiaries,\nAsaba Mall Development Company Ltd and Delta Mall Development Company Ltd that each own an investment property\nin Nigeria. The Group considers it highly probable that these disposal groups will be disposed of and consequently they\nhave been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued\nOperations. Refer to note 4.\n(k) Segment reporting: IFRS 8: Operating Segments requires an entity to identify its operating segments and determine its\nreportable segments. Reportable segments may comprise single operating segments or an aggregation of operating\nsegments. Aggregation of one or more operating segments into a single reportable segment is permitted where certain\nconditions are met; the principle conditions being that the operating segments should have similar economic\ncharacteristics and the operating segments are similar in respect of the products and services offered, nature of\nproduction processes, type or class of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment.\nThe Group’s management has assessed the above mentioned aggregation criteria in respect of its identified retail\noperating segments and believe that it has been satisfied as they have similar average gross margins and similar\nexpected growth rates; therefore it has elected to aggregate the segments as disclosed in note 2.\n(l) Determination of cash-generating units: The Group has determined each store and investment property as a separate\ncash-generating unit for impairment testing.\n(m) Use of exchange rates: All foreign currency translations and foreign currency transactions are translated using the\nofficial exchange rate in line with the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards and foreign exchange regulations in\nindividual countries.\n24\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(n) Hyperinflation: The Group exercises judgement in determining the onset of hyperinflation in countries in which it\noperates and whether the functional currency of its subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements is the currency of a\nhyperinflationary economy.\nVarious characteristics of the economic environment of each country are taken into account to assess whether an\neconomy is hyperinflationary or not. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• The general population prefer to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency;\n• Prices are quoted in a relatively stable foreign currency;\n• Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during\nthe credit period, even if the period is short;\n• Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and\n• The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.\nManagement exercises judgement in determining when a restatement of the financial statements of a Group entity\nbecomes necessary.\nGhana\nThe economy of Ghana was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective from 3 July 2023 and hyperinflation accounting\nwas applied for the year ended 29 June 2025. Accordingly, the results and financial position of the Group’s Ghana\nsubsidiary have been expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.\nDuring the current year, the Group signed an agreement to dispose of the operations in Ghana, which have been\nclassified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued\nOperations. Sale of merchandise included in profit from discontinued operations has increased by R395 million (2024:\nR93 million decrease) due to the hyperinflation impact, while prior period gains of R15 million (2024: R124 million gains),\nwhich arose from the net monetary position, were recognised in other comprehensive income from discontinued\noperations.\nThe general price indices, as published by the Ghana Statistical Service, were used in adjusting the historical cost local\ncurrency results and financial position of the Group’s Ghana subsidiary. The general price index as at the end of the\nreporting period was 257.30 (2024: 226.4). As at 29 June 2025, the cumulative three-year inflation rate was 98.8%\n(2024: 127.1%).\nAngola\nThe economy of Angola was reassessed and found to no longer be hyperinflationary. The hyperinflation accounting was\nceased for the current and comparative year and the cumulative hyperinflation adjustments up to 30 June 2019 will\nunwind over time. The Group will continue to monitor the hyperinflationary nature of Angola.\nThe general price indices, as published by the National Institute of Statistics of Angola, were used in adjusting the\nhistoric cost local currency results and financial positions of the Group’s Angolan subsidiaries up to 30 June 2019.\nAs at 29 June 2025, the cumulative three-year inflation rate was 74.5% (2024: 79.2%).\n(o) Agent versus principal assessment of drop-shipments: The IFRS 15 principles dictate that revenue is recognised as\nand when the control over goods and services is transferred to customers. OK Franchise members may order goods for\ndirect delivery in terms of a drop-shipment arrangement with suppliers, which are pre-approved by the Group, at prices\nnegotiated between the Group and the suppliers. The Group has assessed its drop-shipment sales and concluded that\nthe fact that the Group has a contractual relationship with the suppliers, negotiates prices on behalf of its members and\npays the swell allowance for quality issues to the member, indicates that it is acting as principal in these arrangements.\nThe Group’s drop-shipment sales will therefore continue to be recognised on a gross basis having satisfied the\nrequirements of principal accounting under IFRS 15.\n1.1.1.2 Assumptions and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical\naccounting estimates and assumptions. The most significant assumptions and estimates used in applying the Group’s\naccounting policies relate to the following:\n(a) Rebates from suppliers: Management is required to make estimates in determining the amount and timing of recognition\nof rebates for some transactions with suppliers. In determining the amount of volume-related allowances recognised in any\nperiod, management estimates the probability that the Group will meet contractual target volumes, based on historical and\nforecast performance. There is limited estimation involved in recognising income for promotional and other allowances.\nManagement assesses its performance against the obligations conditional on earning the rebate, with the rebate\nrecognised either over time as the obligations are met, or at the point when all obligations are met, dependent on the\ncontractual requirements. Rebates are recognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the rebate earned relates to\ninventories which are held by the Group at period ends, the rebate is included within the cost of those inventories, and\nrecognised in cost of sales upon sale of those inventories. Management views that the cost of inventories sold (which is\ninclusive of rebates) provides a consistent and complete measure of the statement of comprehensive income impact of\nthe overall supplier relationships.\n25\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.2 Assumptions and estimates continued\n(b) Impairment of assets: The Group performs a review of trading stores as well as investment properties and considers the\nneed for the impairment of assets. This determination requires significant judgement. The Group evaluates amongst other\nthings the near-term business outlook, the possible redeployment of assets between stores and the trading duration of\nthe stores. Refer to note 8.\n(c) Useful lives of assets: In determining the depreciation and amortisation charge for property, plant and equipment,\ninvestment properties and intangible assets, management applies judgement in estimating the useful lives and residual\nvalues of these different asset classes. Refer to notes 3, 5, 7, 27 and 46.\n(d) Income taxes: The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in\ndetermining the worldwide accrual for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated uncertain income tax\npositions for either the most likely amount or the expected value (probability weighted average), based on management’s\nestimates of potential additional taxes due. For the period under review, the Group primarily applied the most likely\namount method to calculate the best estimate of potential cash outflows as management expects this method to better\npredict the resolution of the uncertainties. Management apply judgement to estimate the reasonable likelihood\npercentages using the Group’s experiences of historic successful reductions in similar tax matters, taking into\nconsideration advice from independent experts regarding the merits of each dispute. With regards to deferred income tax\nassets for unutilised income tax losses, judgement is also required to determine whether sufficient future taxable income\nwill be available against which these losses can be utilised. Refer to notes 1.24 and 14.\n(e) Allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets: The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the\nECL associated for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and the Group recognises an\nallowance for ECL on these financial assets. The measurement of the ECL allowance is an area that requires the use of\ncomplex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The ECL\nallowances on financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses\nits judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculations, based on the Group’s\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of the\nkey assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in note 43.4.1.\n(f) Third-party cell captive contracts: Third-party cell captive contracts are measured using the premium allocation\napproach which simplifies the measurement of the net asset for remaining coverage and liabilities for incurred claims.\nRefer to notes 1.27, 11 and 43.5 for details of key assumptions and estimates applied.\n(g) Net realisable value of inventory: Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories are\nphysically verified through the performance of inventory counts in all stores and distribution centres at least once a year,\nwhilst cycle counts are performed daily. Shortages identified during stock takes and daily cycle counts are written off\nimmediately.\nThe Group provides for shrinkage and write-downs below cost to ensure that inventory is carried at net realisable value.\nThe provision for net realisable value of inventory represents management’s estimate of the extent to which merchandise\non hand at the reporting date will be sold below cost. The provision for shrinkage applies the historic shrinkage\npercentage to sales between the most recent inventory count and the reporting date. Refer to note 16.\n(h) Employee benefit accruals and provisions: Various assumptions are applied in determining the valuations of post-\nemployment medical benefits, share-based payment accruals and long-term employee benefits as set out in notes 1.17,\n1.18, 18 and 22.\nEstimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities in a subsequent year relate to the following: impairment of assets; income taxes; expected credit losses and\nemployee benefit allowances.\nAll estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that management\nbelieves are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis of judgements about the\ncarrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and any affected future periods.\n26\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n\n### 1.1.2 Use of adjusted measures\nThe measures listed below are presented as management believes it to be relevant to the understanding of the Group’s\nfinancial performance. These measures are used for internal performance analysis and provide additional useful information\non underlying trends to equity holders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS Accounting Standards and may\ntherefore not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other entities. It is not intended to be a substitute for,\nor superior to, measures as required by IFRS Accounting Standards.\n(a) Trading profit on the face of the statement of comprehensive income, being the Group’s operating results excluding\nforeign exchange rate differences, profit or loss on lease modifications and terminations as well as items of a capital\nnature.\n(b) Items of a capital nature on the face of the statement of comprehensive income, being all re-measurements excluded\nfrom the calculation of headline earnings per share in accordance with the guidance contained in SAICA Circular 1/2023:\nHeadline Earnings. The principal items that will be included under this measure are: gains and losses on disposal and\nscrapping of property, plant and equipment, investment properties, intangible assets and assets classified as held for\nsale; impairments or reversal of impairments; any non-trading items such as gains and losses on disposal of investments,\noperations and subsidiaries.\n(c) Interest received on the face of the statement of comprehensive income, being only interest received on call and\noperating bank account balances.\n\n### 1.2 Consolidation and equity accounting\n\n### 1.2.1 Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by the Group. Control is\nestablished where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the\nability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The nature and effect of existing rights that give the Group the\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another\nentity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer\nconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured at the fair\nvalue of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition.\nIdentifiable assets acquired as well as liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured\ninitially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Acquisition-related\ncosts are expensed as incurred. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share of the\nidentifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the consideration transferred is less than the\nGroup’s share of the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the\nstatement of comprehensive income.\nWhere substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of\nsimilar identifiable assets, the Group may apply an optional concentration test, which simplifies the evaluation of whether an\nacquired set of activities and assets is not a business. In these circumstances, where the Group determines that the assets\nacquired do not represent a business, the relevant recognition and measurement policies are applied to the acquisition of\nthose assets directly. The acquisition of Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd and Resilient Africa Managers (Pty) Ltd has been accounted\nfor as an asset acquisition applying the optional concentration test.\nAll intergroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between entities of the Group have\nbeen eliminated. When necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the\npolicies adopted by the Group.\n\n### 1.2.2 Associates\nAssociates are those entities over which the Group exercises significant influence but not control. Significant influence is\npresumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of another entity. The Group’s\ninvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. Investments in\nassociates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.\nThe Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive\nincome are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and in other comprehensive income respectively, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment, from the date that significant influence commences until\nthe date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its investment\nin the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made\npayments on behalf of the associate. When necessary, accounting policies applied by associates have been changed to\nensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n27\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.2 Consolidation and equity accounting continued\n\n### 1.2.3 Joint arrangements\nJoint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Group exercises joint control in terms of a contractual\nagreement. Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the\nrights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and\ndetermined them to be joint ventures. The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method\nand are initially recognised at cost.\nThe Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive\nincome are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and in other comprehensive income respectively, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment, from the date that joint control commences until the\ndate that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the\njoint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made\npayments on behalf of the joint venture. When necessary, accounting policies applied by joint ventures have been changed\nto ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n### 1.3 Cell captive insurance arrangements\nThe Group has entered into insurance cell arrangements with Old Mutual Life Insurance Company (Namibia) Ltd and\nCentriq Insurance Company Ltd, licensed insurance companies. The Group purchased shares in insurance cells within\nSouth Africa and Namibia.\nThe first-party cells are classified as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) (refer to note 1.14) and\nthe third-party cells as cell captive insurance contracts (refer to note 1.27).\nThe third-party cells issue contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. The risks and rewards associated with these\ncontracts are transferred to the Group through a cell agreement (refer to note 43.5).\nThe net investment is presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position.\n\n### 1.4 Foreign currency translation\n\n### 1.4.1 Functional and presentation currency\nAll items in the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using the\ncurrency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Group’s\nconsolidated financial statements are presented in South Africa rand, which is Shoprite Holdings Ltd’s functional currency\nand the Group’s presentation currency.\n\n### 1.4.2 Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the average exchange rates for the relevant\nmonth. These average exchange rates approximate the spot rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting\nfrom the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies at closing rates, are generally recognised in profit or loss. They are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying net\ninvestment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\n### 1.4.3 Foreign operations\nThe results and the financial position of Group subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements which are not accounted for\nas entities which operate in hyperinflationary economies and that have a functional currency that is different from the\npresentation currency of the Group are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n(a) Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of\nthat statement of financial position;\n(b) Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange\nrates for the period presented; and\n(c) All resulting translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate\ncomponent of equity in the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).\nThe results and financial position of Group entities which are accounted for as entities which operate in hyperinflationary\neconomies and that have a functional currency that is different from the presentation currency of the Group are translated\ninto the presentation currency of its immediate parent at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.\nOn consolidation, exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are also\ntaken to the FCTR. The Group’s net investment in a foreign operation is equal to the equity investment plus all monetary\nitems that are receivable from or payable to the foreign operation, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur\nin the foreseeable future.\n28\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.4 Foreign currency translation continued\n1.4.3 Foreign operations continued\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of, abandoned or sold and the Group loses control, joint control or significant influence\nover the foreign operation, all related exchange rate differences recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated\nin equity in the FCTR are reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on\nthe sale of the operation. On partial disposal of a foreign subsidiary, where a change occurs in the absolute ownership\npercentage held by the Group and control is not lost, a proportionate share of all related exchange rate differences\nrecognised in other comprehensive income is re-attributed to the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. On partial\ndisposal of a foreign joint arrangement or associate, where a change occurs in the absolute ownership percentage held by\nthe Group and joint control or significant influence is not lost, a proportionate share of all related exchange rate differences\nrecognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of\nthe foreign subsidiary and are translated at the closing rate.\n\n### 1.5 Hyperinflation\nThe results, cash flows and financial position, including comparative amounts, of the subsidiary whose functional currencies\nare the currencies of hyperinflationary economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the\nreporting date in accordance.\nAs the presentation currency of the Group is that of a non-hyperinflationary economy, comparative amounts are not adjusted\nfor changes in the price level of exchange rates in the current year. Differences between these comparative amounts and the\nhyperinflation adjusted equity opening balances are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nThe carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect the change in the general price index from\nthe date of acquisition to the end of the reporting period. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the restated\namount of a non-monetary item exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\nGains or losses on the net monetary position are recognised in profit or loss and included in trading profit.\nAll items recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are restated by applying the change in the general price\nindex from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially earned or incurred.\nAt the beginning of the first period of application, the components of owners’ equity, except for retained earnings, are\nrestated by applying a general price index from the dates the components were contributed or otherwise arose. These\nrestatements are recognised in other comprehensive income. Restated retained earnings are derived from all other amounts\nin the restated statement of financial position.\nAt the end of the first period and in the subsequent periods, all components of owners’ equity are restated by applying a\ngeneral price index from the beginning of the period or the date of contribution, if later.\nAll items in the statement of cash flows are expressed in terms of the general price index at the end of the reporting period.\n\n### 1.6 Hedging activities: net investment hedging\nIn accordance with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), certain foreign currency denominated financial liabilities are\ndesignated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Group uses non-derivative financial liabilities to reduce\nexposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the Group’s net investments in certain foreign\noperations.\nThe Group documents, at the inception of the hedging transaction, the economic relationship between hedging instruments\nand hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.\nAny gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in the FCTR in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is\nrecognised immediately in profit or loss.\nThe Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, when a hedge no\nlonger meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when the designation is revoked. Gains and losses accumulated in the\nFCTR at that time remains in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or\nsold. Refer to note 1.4.3.\n29\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n\n### 1.7 Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are tangible assets held by the Group for use in the supply of goods, rental to others or\nadministrative purposes and are expected to be used during more than one period. All property, plant and equipment are\nstated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. The historical cost includes all\nexpenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the buildings, machinery, equipment and vehicles and is\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis, from the date it is available for use, at rates appropriate to the various classes of assets\ninvolved, taking into account the estimated useful life and residual values of the individual items. Land is not depreciated, as\nit has an unlimited useful life. Improvements to leasehold properties are shown at cost and written off over the shorter of the\nremaining period of the lease and the items’ useful life.\nManagement determines the estimated useful lives, residual values and the related depreciation charges at acquisition and\nthese are reviewed at each reporting date. If appropriate, adjustments are made and accounted for prospectively as a\nchange in estimate. During the year, the estimated useful life of racking has been adjusted to 20 years (previously 15 years)\nand shelving has been adjusted to 10 years (previously 6 years). Refer to note 46.\nUseful lives:\nBuildings 20 years\nMachinery 5 to 10 years\nRacking 20 years\nShelving 10 years\nVehicles 5 to 10 years\nTrolleys 3 to 5 years\nEquipment 4 to 10 years\nSafes 20 years\nComputer equipment 3 to 5 years\nAircraft and its components 33 to 50 years\nThe cost of major refurbishments is capitalised as property, plant and equipment to the extent that it can be recovered from\nfuture use of the assets. The capitalised amounts are depreciated over the relevant write-off periods. All other repairs and\nmaintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the period in which these are incurred.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, property, plant\nand equipment relating to this subsidiary are restated by applying the change in the general price indices from the date of\nacquisition to the current reporting date (refer to note 1.5).\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater\nthan its estimated recoverable amount.\nGains and losses on disposal or scrapping of property, plant and equipment, being the difference between the net proceeds\non disposal or scrapping and the carrying amount, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n### 1.8 Investment properties\nProperties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in production, supply of goods or\nservices, or for administrative purposes or for sale in the ordinary course of business, are classified as investment properties.\nInvestment properties are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The historical cost\nincludes all expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the buildings and land.\nInvestment properties are depreciated on the straight-line basis over 20 years. This rate is considered to be appropriate to\nreduce the buildings to their estimated residual value over their useful life.\nManagement determines the estimated useful lives, residual values and the related depreciation charges at acquisition and\nthese are reviewed at each reporting date. If appropriate, adjustments are made and accounted for prospectively as a\nchange in estimate.\nRepairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they\nare incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the assets when it is probable that future\neconomic benefits in excess of original assessed standards of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group. Major\nrenovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\nThe carrying amount of investment properties are written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying\namount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal or scrapping of investment\nproperties, being the difference between the net proceeds on disposal or scrapping and the carrying amount, are recognised\nin the statement of comprehensive income.\n30\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n\n### 1.9 Intangible assets\n\n### 1.9.1 Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the\nacquired subsidiary or operation at the date of acquisition. Goodwill denominated in a foreign currency is translated at\nclosing rates. Goodwill is tested for impairment at each reporting date and whenever there is an indication of impairment.\nGoodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. It is not amortised, as it has an indefinite useful life. Goodwill\nis allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or\ngroups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Each of those\nCGUs represents the Group’s investment in a trading unit or a group of trading units. Gains and losses on the disposal of an\nentity that has related goodwill include the carrying amount of the related goodwill. An impairment loss recognised for\ngoodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\n### 1.9.2 Software, trademarks and customer relationships\nIntangible assets are held by the Group for use in the supply of goods or administrative purposes and are expected to be\nused during more than one period. Acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and intangible assets acquired\nin a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets, other than goodwill and\ncustomer relationships which have an indefinite useful life, are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation\nand accumulated impairment. The cost of intangible assets includes all costs incurred to acquire the intangible assets and\nbring it into use and is amortised on a straight-line basis, from the date it is available for use, at rates appropriate to the\nvarious classes of intangible assets involved, taking into account the estimated useful life and residual values of the\nindividual items.\nCosts associated with implementing or maintaining intangible assets are recognised as an expense when incurred. Costs\nthat are directly associated with the purchase and customisation of identifiable and unique intangible assets controlled by\nthe Group, and that will probably generate future economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.\nDirect costs include the intangible asset development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.\nManagement determines the estimated useful lives, residual values and the related amortisation charges at acquisition and\nthese are reviewed at each reporting date. If appropriate, adjustments are made and accounted for prospectively as a\nchange in estimate. During the year under review, the estimated useful life of software has been adjusted to 1 to 20 years,\npreviously 1 to 10 years. Refer to note 46.\nUseful lives:\nSoftware 1 to 20 years\nTrademarks 16 to 20 years\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, intangible assets\nrelating to this subsidiary are restated by applying the change in the general price indices from the date of acquisition to the\ncurrent reporting date (refer to note 1.5).\nAn intangible asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the intangible asset’s carrying\namount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\nGains and losses on disposal or scrapping of intangible assets, being the difference between the net proceeds on disposal\nor scrapping and the carrying amount, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\n1.10 Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations\n\n### 1.10.1 Non-current assets classified as held for sale\nNon-current assets and/or disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale and are stated at the lower of the carrying\namount and fair value less costs of disposal if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction\nrather than through continued use and this sale is considered highly probable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less\ncosts to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group),\nbut not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the\ndate of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.\nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are\nclassified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for\nsale continue to be recognised.\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented\nseparately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for\nsale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.\nAssets and liabilities of abandoned disposal groups are not classified as held for sale because the carrying amounts will not\nbe recovered principally through a sale transaction.\n31\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.10 Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations continued\n1.10.2 Discontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of, abandoned or is classified as held for sale\nand that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan\nto dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. An\nabandoned operation is classified as a discontinued operation when it has been closed. The results of discontinued\noperations are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n### 1.11 Impairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill and customer relationships, being the Group’s only non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life, is not subject\nto depreciation and amortisation and is tested for impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Other assets that are subject to depreciation and amortisation are\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable. The determination of whether an asset is impaired requires significant management judgement and the following\nfactors, amongst others, will be considered: duration and extent to which the fair value of the assets is less than its cost;\nindustry, geographical and sector performance; changes in regional economies; and operational and financing cash flows.\nWhere the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is impaired and the\nasset is written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the asset’s fair value\nless costs of disposal and the value-in-use. These calculations are prepared based on management’s assumptions and\nestimates such as forecasted cash flows; management budgets; and industry, regional and geographical operational and\nfinancial outlooks. For the purpose of impairment testing, the assets are allocated to CGUs or a group of CGUs. CGUs are\nthe lowest levels for which separately identifiable cash flows can be determined. The related impairment expense is charged\nto the statement of comprehensive income as expenditure of a capital nature.\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior\nperiods for an asset, other than goodwill and customer relationships, may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any\nsuch indication exists the Group will immediately recognise the reversal as income of a capital nature in the statement of\ncomprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill and customer relationships shall not be reversed in a\nsubsequent period.\n\n### 1.12 Leases\n\n### 1.12.1 Where the Group is the lessee\n(a) Leasing activities and how they are accounted for\nThe Group leases various offices, distribution centres, retail stores, vehicles and equipment. Rental contracts are typically\nentered into for fixed periods, with extension options as follows:\n• Properties: five to 10 years, with extension options for a further 15 to 20 years.\n• Commercial vehicle fleet: one to 12 years, with an option to renew.\n• Multifunctional printers: three years, with month to month extension options.\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to\nthe lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. Non-lease components are expensed as\nthey become due.\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease\nagreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.\nLeased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.\nA right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date at which the leased asset is available\nfor use by the Group. They are initially measured on a present value basis.\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n• Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n• Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the\ncommencement date;\n• The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n• Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\nThe Group’s current rental portfolio does not include termination penalties. However, should these become relevant in the\nfuture, such payments will also be included in the initial measurement of the lease liability.\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not\nincluded in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take\neffect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the\nlessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the\nfunds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with\nsimilar terms, security and conditions. The Group discounts lease payments for its commercial vehicle fleet using the\ninterest rate implicit in the lease. All other lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.\n32\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.12 Leases continued\n1.12.1 Where the Group is the lessee continued\n(a) Leasing activities and how they are accounted for continued\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:\n• Where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to\nreflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;\n• Uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the lessee,\nwhich does not have recent third-party financing; and\n• Makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease payments\nare allocated between principal and finance costs. Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as\nto produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n• The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n• Any lease prepayments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\n• Any initial direct costs;\n• Restoration costs; and\n• Subsequent remeasurement of the lease liability.\nAfter initial recognition the cost of the right-of-use asset is adjusted to include the subsequent remeasurement of the\nlease liability. Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the underlying asset’s useful life and the\nlease term on a straight-line basis. In instances where the ownership transfers from the lessor to the lessee, the right-of-\nuse assets are depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, right-of-use\nassets relating to this subsidiary are restated by applying the change in the general price indices from the date of\nacquisition to the current reporting date (refer to note 1.5).\nPayments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets (with a cost\nprice below R75 000) are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases\nwith a lease term of 12 months or less.\n(b) Variable lease payments\nSome property leases (2025: 53.3%; 2024: 52.8%) contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from\na store. Turnover rentals, where applicable, average 2.2% (2024: 2.1%) of turnover. Variable payment terms are used for a\nvariety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease payments that\ndepend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\nA 10% increase in sales across all stores in the Group with such variable lease contracts would increase total lease\npayments by approximately R55 million (2024: R53 million).\n(c) Extension and termination options\nThe lease term includes any non-cancellable periods and reasonably certain termination or extension option periods.\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and commercial vehicle fleet leases across the\nGroup. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations.\nThe majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.\nThe average lease term of the Group’s portfolio of qualifying leases are as follows:\n2025 2024\nDistribution centres 9.6 years 9.9 years\nStorage and warehousing 4.7 years 4.6 years\nOther properties 8.7 years 8.5 years\nCommercial vehicle fleet 5.0 years 5.0 years\nMultifunctional printers 3.0 years 3.0 years\n33\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.12 Leases continued\n\n### 1.12.2 Where the Group is the lessor\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of\nownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the\nsublease classification is assessed with reference to the head lease right-of-use asset.\nFinance leases\nAt the commencement date of a sublease agreement, the right-of-use asset of the head lease is derecognised, and the\nGroup recognises a net investment in lease receivables. The net investment in lease receivables is measured as the present\nvalue of the lease payments to be received over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the\ninterest rate implicit in the sublease cannot be readily determined, the discount rate for the head lease is used. Any\ndifference between the right-of-use asset and net investment in lease receivables is recognised in profit or loss.\nThe lease liabilities of the head leases are accounted for in terms of note 1.12.1.\nNet investment in lease receivables is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\nLease payments received are allocated between principal and finance income. Finance income is charged to profit or loss\nover the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the receivable for\neach period.\nNet investment in lease receivables is assessed for impairment at each reporting date as financial assets in accordance with\nnote 1.14.5.\nOperating leases\nPortions of owner-occupied properties and leased properties are leased or subleased out under operating leases. The\nowner-occupied properties are included in property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position. Rental\nincome in respect of operating leases with a fixed escalation clause is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Incentives received to enter into a lease agreement are released to the statement of comprehensive income as\noperating lease income over the lease term. All other rental income is recognised as it becomes due.\nWhen an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment received from the lessee by way of\npenalty is recognised as income and any unamortised portion of the fixed escalation lease accrual is recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income in the period in which termination takes place.\n\n### 1.13 Sale and leaseback transactions\nA sale and leaseback transaction is where the Group sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of the asset by\nentering into a lease with the buyer. A sale occurs when control of the underlying asset passes to the buyer. This accounting\npolicy thus applies in instances where the Group, as the seller-lessee, has transferred control of the asset to the buyer-lessor\nin terms of an IFRS 15 sale.\nAs the Group is the lessee in the subsequent arrangement, a lease liability is recognised, the associated property, plant and\nequipment asset is derecognised, and a right-of-use asset is recognised at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of\nthe asset relating to the right-of-use retained. The gain (or loss) that the seller-lessee recognises is limited to the proportion\nof the total gain (or loss) that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. Any difference between the sale\nconsideration and the fair value of the asset is either a prepayment of lease payments (if the purchase price is below market\nterms) or an additional financing (if the purchase price is above market terms). Any gain or loss that relates to the rights\ntransferred to the buyer-lessor is recorded within items of a capital nature.\nIn other instances, where there is no transfer of control, the transaction amounts to a collateralised borrowing, which is\ncovered by the existing accounting policies pertaining to financial liabilities as described in note 1.14.\n\n### 1.14 Other financial instruments\n\n### 1.14.1 Initial recognition and measurement\nIn addition to lease liabilities, financial instruments recognised on the statement of financial position include investments at\nfair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), first-party insurance cell captive arrangements, government bonds\nand bills, loans receivable, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade and\nother payables, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities.\nThese financial instruments are recognised at trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of\nthe instrument. Trade and other receivables with no significant financing component are initially measured at transaction\nprice. Other financial instruments not measured at FVPL are initially recognised at fair value including directly attributable\ntransaction costs. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n### 1.14.2 Derecognition\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or have been\ntransferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are\nderecognised when they are extinguished, i.e. when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled, expires or when a\nsubstantial modification of the terms occurs.\n34\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.14 Other financial instruments continued\n\n### 1.14.3 Offsetting\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when there is a\nlegally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n### 1.14.4 Classification and subsequent measurement\nFinancial assets\nThe Group classifies financial assets according to the following categories:\n• Financial assets at amortised cost\n• Financial assets held at FVOCI\n• Financial assets held at FVPL\nFinancial assets at amortised cost\nThe classification and subsequent measurement of debt investments depend on the Group’s business model for managing\nthe financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual\ncash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, using\nthe effective interest rate method, less allowance made for impairment of these assets.\nInterest income from these financial assets is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount,\nexcept for:\n• Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. For these financial assets the Group applies the credit-adjusted\neffective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition; and\n• Financial assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets but subsequently have become\ncredit-impaired financial assets. For these financial assets, the Group applies the effective interest rate to the amortised\ncost of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.\nInitiation fees, which are considered to be an integral part of the effective interest rate, are accounted for over the shorter of\nthe original contractual term and the actual term of the loan or credit sale using the effective interest rate.\nAny gain or loss arising on derecognition, modification or impairment is recognised directly in profit or loss.\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those financial assets\nchanges.\nThe following debt investments are measured at amortised cost in terms of the Group’s business model of holding these\nfinancial assets to collect solely payments of principal and interest:\n(a) Government bonds and bills: These financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable\nprincipal and interest payments and fixed maturities for which the Group intends to hold them to maturity to collect\ncontractual cash flows. Government bonds and bills are included under non-current assets unless it matures within\n12 months after the reporting date. Interest on government bonds and bills is recognised in the statement of\ncomprehensive income as interest revenue.\n(b) Loans receivable: Loans receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not\nquoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no\nintention of trading the receivable. The Group holds the loans receivable with the objective to collect contractual cash\nflows and the contractual terms of the loans receivable are solely payments of principal and interest. These financial\nassets are included under current assets unless it matures later than 12 months after the reporting date. Interest on loans\nreceivable is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as interest revenue.\n(c) Trade and other receivables: Trade receivables consist mainly of amounts receivable for the sale of merchandise to\nfranchisees, medical aid schemes, pharmacies, doctors and buying aid societies. Furthermore, the Group has entered\ninto various instalment sale agreements for household furniture. Other receivables consist of various operational debtors\nsuch as rental and municipal deposits refundable and insurance claims receivable. A finance sublease agreement was\nentered into previously and is included as a net investment in lease receivables. Trade and other receivables are held to\ncollect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the trade and other receivables are solely payments of\nprincipal and interest. Interest on trade and other receivables is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as\ninterest revenue.\n(d) Restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities: Cash comprises cash\non hand and cash at banks. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to\nknown amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Interest on cash and cash equivalents\nis recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as interest received from bank account balances. Restricted\ncash, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial\nposition.\n35\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.14 Other financial instruments continued\n1.14.4 Classification and subsequent measurement continued\nFinancial assets held at FVOCI\n(e) Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income: Investments at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income include equity shares of non-listed companies. The Group holds a non-controlling interest in these\ncompanies. At initial recognition, the Group has irrevocably elected to classify these strategic investments as financial\nassets held at FVOCI. At the reporting date the fair value is determined based on the net asset value of the companies.\nFinancial assets held at FVPL\nThe following financial assets are measured at FVPL as they do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI:\n(f) First-party insurance cell captive arrangements: The first-party insurance cell captive arrangements are measured at\nFVPL on initial recognition. At the reporting date the fair value is determined based on the net asset value of the\nunderlying cell captive arrangements.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The\neffective interest rate amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as finance costs.\nFinancial liabilities, other than lease liabilities, measured at amortised cost on the statement of financial position include\nborrowings, trade and other payables, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities:\n(g) Borrowings: Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the unconditional right to defer\nsettlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Refer to note 1.21 for the Group’s accounting\npolicy with regards to the capitalisation of borrowing costs.\n(h) Trade and other payables: Trade and other payables mainly comprise trade payables for the purchase of merchandise\nfor resale and are short-term in nature.\nNon-convertible, non-participating, non-transferable no par value deferred shares, which are mandatorily acquirable on a\nspecific date, are classified as other payables.\n\n### 1.14.5 Impairment\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated for all debt instruments not held at FVPL and the Group\nrecognises an allowance for ECL. ECL are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance\nwith the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.\nThe expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are\nintegral to the contractual terms.\nThe impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\nThe Group has the following types of financial assets measured at amortised cost that are subject to impairment under the\nECL models:\nFinancial asset ECL model applied for impairment\nGovernment bonds and bills General impairment approach\nLoans receivable General impairment approach\nInstalment sale receivables Simplified approach\nTrade receivables Provision matrix\nOther receivables General impairment approach\nNet investment in lease receivables Simplified approach\nRestricted cash General impairment approach\nCash and cash equivalents General impairment approach\n(a) General impairment approach\nThe Group applies the general impairment approach to measure ECL for government bonds and bills, loans receivable,\nother receivables, restricted cash as well as cash and cash equivalents. The Group assesses at the end of each reporting\nperiod whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\nIn the event of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the Group recognises an allowance (or\nprovision) for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).\nFinancial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be ’stage 1’; financial assets which are considered\nto have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ’stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective\nevidence of impairment are considered to be in default, or otherwise credit-impaired, are in ’stage 3’.\nThe measurement of ECL under the general impairment approach reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value\nof money and the best forward-looking information available to the Group. The probability-weighted outcome\nincorporates the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), timing of when default is likely to occur and loss\ngiven default (LGD).\n36\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.14 Other financial instruments continued\n1.14.5 Impairment continued\n(b) Simplified approach\nFor instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables with a significant financing component, the Group has elected\nto measure the impairment allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL. This policy will be applied to all instalment\nsale and net investment in lease receivables.\nThe measurement of ECL under the simplified impairment approach reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time\nvalue of money and the best forward-looking information available to the Group.\n(c) Provision matrix\nFor trade and other receivables without a significant financing component, the Group applies the simplified approach\nwhich recognises lifetime ECL. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on historical payment profiles\nand credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to such trade and other receivables and the\neconomic environment.\nThe Group recognises in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or reversal, the amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to\nadjust the loss allowance at the end of the reporting period. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the\nallowance for impairment for that receivable. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income.\nNote 43.4.1 provides more detail on how the Group determines a significant increase in credit risk and how the expected\ncredit loss allowance is measured.\n\n### 1.15 Inventories\nTrading inventories are initially measured at cost using the weighted average cost formula. Subsequent to initial recognition,\ninventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of merchandise is the net of: invoice price of\nmerchandise; insurance; freight; customs duties; an appropriate allocation of distribution costs between distribution centres\nand stores; trade discounts; advertising and other rebates and settlement discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated\nselling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling and distribution expenses. The carrying amount of\ninventories sold is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.\nThe carrying value of inventory comprises the stock on hand at the reporting date net of any provision raised for inventory\nwrite-downs and shrinkage.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, inventories\nrelating to this subsidiary are measured at the lower of the restated cost and net realisable value (refer to note 1.5).\n\n### 1.16 Stated capital\nOrdinary shares, including incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, are both classified as equity.\nWhere entities controlled by the Group purchase the Company’s shares, the consideration paid, including attributable\ntransaction costs net of income taxes, is deducted from capital and reserves attributable to owners of the parent as treasury\nshares until they are sold. Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received is included in capital and\nreserves attributable to owners of the parent. Dividends received on treasury shares are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n### 1.17 Employee benefit and other provisions\nEmployee benefit and other provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a\nresult of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the\nobligation; and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. The Group has discounted provisions to\ntheir present value where the effect of the time value of money is material. The notional interest charge representing the\nunwinding of the provision discounting is included in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n### 1.17.1 Long-term employee benefits\nLong-term employee benefits are provided to employees who achieve certain predetermined milestones of service within the\nGroup. The Group’s obligation under these plans is valued by independent qualified actuaries at year-end and the\ncorresponding liability is raised. Payments are set off against the liability. Movements in the liability, including notional\ninterest, resulting from the valuation by the actuaries are charged against the statement of comprehensive income as\nemployee benefits.\n\n### 1.17.2 Reinstatement provision\nWhere it has a contractual obligation in respect of certain lease agreements, the Group provides the estimate of the cost of\ndismantling and removing an item of property, plant and equipment and restoring the site on which the item was located to\nits original condition at the expiry of the lease.\nThe Group also provides for the anticipated costs associated with the restoration of leasehold property to its original\ncondition at inception of the lease, including removal of items included in property, plant and equipment or right-of-use\nassets that are erected on leased land.\n37\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n\n### 1.18 Employee benefits\n\n### 1.18.1 Pension obligations\nThe Group operates various pension schemes. The schemes are funded through payments to trustee-administered funds in\naccordance with the plan terms.\nProvident fund\nA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The\nGroup has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay\nall employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans, in respect of services rendered in a particular period, are recognised\nas an expense in that period. Additional contributions are recognised as an expense in the period during which the\nassociated services are rendered by employees.\n\n### 1.18.2 Post-employment medical benefits\nThe Group provides for post-employment medical benefits, where they exist. The expected costs of these benefits are\naccrued over the period of employment based on past services and charged to the statement of comprehensive income as\nemployee benefits. This post-employment medical benefit obligation is measured at present value by discounting the\nestimated future cash outflows. Valuations of this obligation are carried out annually by independent qualified actuaries using\nthe projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised immediately in equity as other comprehensive\nincome. Settlement premiums, when incurred, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as\nemployee benefits.\n\n### 1.18.3 Equity-settled share-based payments\nThe Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan under which it receives services from employees as\nconsideration for equity instruments of the Company. The beneficiaries under the scheme are Executive Directors and\nmanagement. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment\nreserve.\nThe total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted, including any market\nperformance conditions and excluding the impact of any non-market performance vesting conditions. Non-market\nperformance vesting conditions are included in assumptions regarding the number of shares granted that are expected to\nvest. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares granted that are expected\nto vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income, with\na corresponding adjustment to equity.\nFull share grants awarded may be settled by way of a purchase of shares in the market, use of treasury shares or issue of\nnew shares. If new shares are issued to equity-settle full share grants, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable\ntransaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.\nWhere shares are held or acquired by subsidiary companies for equity compensation plans, they are treated as treasury\nshares. Any gains or losses on vesting of such shares are recognised directly in equity.\nThe effect of all full share grants issued under the share-based compensation plan is taken into account when calculating\ndiluted earnings and diluted headline earnings per share.\n\n### 1.18.4 Cash-settled share-based payments\nThe Group recognises a liability for cash-settled share-based payments calculated at the current fair value determined at\neach reporting date. The fair value is calculated using relevant pricing models. This amount is expensed through the\nstatement of comprehensive income over the vesting periods.\n\n### 1.18.5 Bonus plans\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses, based on formulas that take into consideration the Group’s\ntrading profit after certain adjustments or the Company’s dividend forecasts, depending on the qualifying criteria. The accrual\nfor this liability is made where a contractual or constructive obligation exists.\nAn accrual for employees who qualify but have not been in service for the required period is recognised as a long-term\nemployee benefit.\n\n### 1.19 Revenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised either over time or at a point in time, as or when the Group satisfies\nperformance obligations and transfers control of goods or services to its customers at an amount that reflects the\nconsideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for these goods or services, allocated to each specific\nperformance obligation. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.\n38\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.19 Revenue from contracts with customers continued\n\n### 1.19.1 Sale of merchandise\nThe Group operates a chain of retail stores and, to a small degree, franchise stores selling products such as food, clothing,\ngeneral merchandise, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and liquor. It also sells products to franchisees under drop-shipment\narrangements and operates furniture stores retailing products such as furniture, household appliances and home\nentertainment systems.\nRevenue for the sale of merchandise from ordinary Group-operating activities including through Sixty60, net of value added\ntax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group are recognised at a point in time, upon delivery of\nproducts and customer acceptance. The Group acquired the remaining 50% shareholding of its equity accounted joint\nventure Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd during the financial year.\nThis wholly owned subsidiary is the Group’s last-mile logistics provider. This acquisition resulted in the Group’s performance\nobligations for Sixty60 delivery recoveries changing to one obligation i.e., delivery of products and customer acceptance,\naccordingly this income is included as sale of merchandise subsequent to this acquisition.\nThe Group’s Xtra Savings Rewards Programme offers immediate discount which is recognised as a reduction in revenue,\nsince it does not create a separate performance obligation providing a material right to a future discount. Payment is usually\nreceived via cash, debit card or credit card. Related card transaction costs are recognised in the statement of\ncomprehensive income as other expenses. When merchandise is sold under instalment sale agreements, the present value\nof the instalment sale payments is recognised as a receivable.\nIt is the Group’s policy to sell goods with a right of return in terms of current consumer legislation. Such sales are cancelled\nwhere the right of return is exercised. A refund liability for the expected refunds to customers is recognised as an adjustment\nto revenue in trade and other payables. The accumulated experience of the Group’s returns has been utilised to estimate\nsuch refund liability at the time of sale. Based on past experience it is estimated that goods returned in a saleable condition\nwill be insignificant and therefore, the Group does not recognise an asset and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales\nfor its right to recover the product from the customer where the customer exercises his right of return. The validity of this\nassumption and the estimated amount of returns are reassessed at each reporting date.\n\n### 1.19.2 Lay-by sales\nProceeds from lay-by sales are initially recognised as contract liabilities, deferring the revenue. Revenues are recognised\nwhen the customer takes possession or forfeits the merchandise.\n\n### 1.19.3 Gift vouchers and saving stamps\nProceeds from the sale of gift vouchers and saving stamps are initially recognised as contract liabilities, deferring the\nrevenue. Revenues are recognised as sale of merchandise when the gift vouchers or saving stamps are redeemed.\nProceeds from the sale of gift vouchers and saving stamps give customers the right to receive goods or services in the\nfuture. However, customers occasionally do not exercise all of their contractual rights. The Group recognises the expected\nbreakage amount in such contract liabilities as revenue, in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by its customers. The\naccumulated experience of the Group’s breakage history is utilised to estimate when it expects to be entitled to a breakage\namount. The validity of this assumption and the estimated amount of breakage are reassessed at each reporting date.\n\n### 1.19.4 Commissions received\nThe Group acts as a payment office for the services and products provided by a variety of third parties to the Group’s\ncustomers. The agent’s commissions received by the Group from the third parties for the payment office service are\nrecognised as alternative revenue. Commissions relating to third-party products are recognised when the underlying third-\nparty payments take place. Commissions relating to third-party services are recognised based on the stage of completion by\nreference to services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed.\n\n### 1.19.5 Franchise fees received\nFranchise fees received comprise fees received from franchisees and are recognised as alternative revenue when the\nunderlying sales, which give rise to the income, occur.\n\n### 1.19.6 Marketing and media revenue\nRevenue from marketing and media comprises revenue from various channels, including virtual, digital as well as in-store\nprinted advertising, and is recognised as alternative revenue over the period of the campaign or promotion.\n\n### 1.19.7 Delivery recoveries\nRevenue from delivery recoveries from Sixty60, prior to acquiring the remaining 50% shareholding of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd\nas disclosed in note 38.5.2, and the furniture business is recognised as alternative revenue upon delivery of products to\ncustomers.\n\n### 1.19.8 Financing components\nExcept when merchandise is sold under instalment sale agreements, the Group does not expect to have any contracts\nwhere the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer\nexceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n39\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n\n### 1.20 Alternative revenue\nAlternative revenue is recognised as follows:\n\n### 1.20.1 Effective interest income\nInterest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of financial assets except for\nfinancial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired (or “stage 3”) for which interest revenue is calculated by applying\nthe effective interest rate to their net carrying amount (i.e. gross carrying amount less impairment provision). The effective\ninterest rate calculation does not consider ECL but includes initiation fees as they are integral to the effective interest rate.\n\n### 1.20.2 Operating lease income\nRental income in respect of operating leases with a fixed escalation clause is recognised on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. All other rental income is recognised as it becomes due. Refer to note 1.12.2.\n\n### 1.20.3 Dividend income\nDividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.\n\n### 1.21 Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that\nnecessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised to the cost of that\nqualifying asset. The Group considers a period longer than 12 months to be a substantial period of time.\nGeneral borrowing costs are capitalised by calculating the weighted average expenditure on the qualifying asset and\napplying a weighted average borrowing rate to the expenditure. Specific borrowing costs are capitalised according to the\nborrowing costs incurred on the specific borrowing, provided the borrowing facility is utilised specifically for the qualifying\nasset. All other borrowing costs incurred are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income and are\naccrued on a time basis by reference to the principal amounts outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.\n\n### 1.22 Rebates from suppliers\nConsistent with standard industry practice, the Group has agreements with suppliers whereby volume-related allowances,\npromotional and marketing allowances and various other fees and discounts are received in connection with the purchase of\ngoods for resale from those suppliers. Most of the income received from suppliers relates to adjustments to a core cost price\nof a product, and as such is considered part of the purchase price for that product. Sometimes receipt of the income is\nconditional on the Group performing specified actions or satisfying certain performance conditions associated with the\npurchase of the product. These include achieving agreed purchases or sales volume targets and providing promotional or\nmarketing materials and activities or promotional product positioning.\nRebates from suppliers are recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning\nincome have been discharged, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. The income is\nrecognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the income earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at\nperiod ends, the income is included within the cost of those inventories, and recognised in cost of sales upon sale of those\ninventories.\nAmounts due relating to rebates from suppliers are recognised within trade and other receivables, except in cases where the\nGroup currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and intends to offset amounts due from suppliers against amounts\nowed to those suppliers, in which case only the net amount receivable or payable is recognised. Accrued rebates are\nrecognised within accrued income when rebates earned have not been invoiced at the reporting date.\n\n### 1.23 Cost of sales\nCost of sales primarily comprises the cost of goods sold and services provided, including an allocation of direct overhead\nexpenses, net of supplier rebates, and costs incurred that are necessary to acquire and store goods. Cost of sales also\nincludes: the cost to distribute goods to customers where delivery is invoiced; inbound freight costs; internal transfer costs\nbetween distribution centres and stores; warehousing costs and the cost of other shipping and handling activities; and\nany write-downs and reversals of write-downs to inventory. Prior to acquiring the remaining 50% shareholding of\nPingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd as disclosed in note 38.5.2, cost of sales did not include delivery fees from the Group’s Sixty60\non-demand business which was included in other operating expenses.\n\n### 1.24 Current and deferred income tax\nThe income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax is recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case\nit will also be recognised directly in equity.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, for calculated income tax losses and temporary differences\narising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. However,\nthe deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other\nthan a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the\nreporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax\nliability is settled.\n40\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.24 Current and deferred income tax continued\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against\nwhich temporary differences can be utilised. Management applies judgement to determine whether sufficient future taxable\nprofit will be available after considering, amongst others, factors such as profit histories, forecasted cash flows and budgets.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries,\nassociates and joint arrangements, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by\nthe Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required to determine whether an obligation should be\nrecognised as a liability or disclosed as a contingent liability (refer to note 39). There are many transactions and calculations\nduring the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination can be uncertain for a considerable period of\ntime, requiring management to estimate the related income tax positions. Significant judgement is therefore required in\ndetermining the worldwide accrual for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated uncertain income tax\npositions based on management’s best informed estimates, when it is probable that additional taxes will be due. To measure\nthe liabilities for uncertain tax positions, management determines whether uncertainties need to be considered separately or\ntogether based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Where the final income tax outcome of\nthese matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax\nand deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Pillar Two rules were enacted in South Africa on 24 December 2024 and is retrospectively effective from 1 January 2024\nfor groups with fiscal years commencing on or after that date. The Group determined that the global minimum top-up tax\nwould be an income tax within the scope of IAS12. The Group will be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its\neffective tax rate per jurisdiction in terms of the Pillar Two rules and the 15% minimum rate.\nThe Group has elected to apply the temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax and therefore has not determined the\nimpact of Pillar Two on deferred tax in accordance with the amendments to IAS12 issued in May 2023.\nThe Group has performed an assessment of its potential exposure in relation to the Pillar Two legislation for the 2025\nfinancial year. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the Group does not anticipate being subject to a material top-up\ntax exposure in any of the jurisdiction in which it operates.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, deferred income\ntax relating to this subsidiary is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their restated carrying amounts (refer to note 1.5).\n\n### 1.25 Earnings per share\nEarnings and headline earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to owners of the parent and\nheadline earnings respectively, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the\nordinary shares held by the Group as treasury shares.\nFor the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume\nconversion of all ordinary shares with dilutive potential. Full share grants have dilutive potential. The full share grants are\nassumed to have been converted into ordinary shares. It has no effect on net profit and therefore no adjustment is made to\nnet profit for full share grants.\nHeadline earnings are calculated in accordance with Circular 1/2023 issued by SAICA as required by the JSE Limited\nListings Requirements.\n\n### 1.26 Dividends distributed to shareholders\nDividends are accounted for on the date they have been declared by the Company.\n\n### 1.27 Basis of accounting for third-party cell captive contracts\n\n### 1.27.1 Classification of contracts\nInsurance risk is risk other than financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer. The Group has insurance\nrisk through third-party cell captive contracts due to its obligation to recapitalise the cells and therefore IFRS 17 is applied in\nrecognition of these contracts.\nContracts entered into by the Group that compensate another insurer for losses incurred on insurance contracts issued and\nfulfil the criteria for classification as insurance contracts, are designated as inwards reinsurance contracts issued. All\nreferences made to insurance contracts apply equally to reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group.\nContracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to\ncompensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the\npolicyholder or other beneficiary, are classified as insurance contracts.\nAn insurance risk is deemed significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional\nbenefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance. If significant additional benefits would be\npayable in scenarios that have commercial substance, the condition in the previous sentence may be met even if the insured\nevent is extremely unlikely or even if the expected (i.e. probability-weighted) present value of contingent cash flows is a small\nproportion of the expected present value of all the remaining contractual cash flows.\n41\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.27 Basis of accounting for third-party cell captive contracts continued\n\n### 1.27.2 Recognition and measurement of contracts\n(a) Recognition\nThe Group recognises insurance contracts it issues from the earliest of the beginning of the coverage period of the\ncontracts; and the date when the first payment from a policyholder becomes due, or is received where there is no\ndue date.\n(b) Measurement\nIncluded in the measurement of the Group’s insurance contracts are all the future cash flows within the boundary of each\ncontract. Cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract refer to cash flows that arise from substantive rights\nand obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the policyholder is obligated by the Group to pay the\npremiums, or in which the Group has a substantive obligation to render insurance contract services to the policyholder.\nThe premium allocation approach is applied to all insurance contracts entered into by the Group. The asset for remaining\ncoverage is measured as the difference between premiums received at initial recognition, and any insurance acquisition\ncash flows at the date of inception of the contract. Where the coverage period is one year or less the insurance\nacquisition cash flows are expensed. For contracts with a coverage period of more than one year the insurance\nacquisition cash flows are capitalised and then amortised. The carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage is\nmeasured as:\n• The sum of all capital contributions received;\n• Less insurance acquisition expenses;\n• Less dividends paid by the cell; and\n• Plus insurance revenue recognised in respect of services provided during the reporting period.\nThe liabilities for incurred claims are estimated as the fulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims and incurred\nexpenses. These cash flows consider all reasonable and supportable information available at a reasonable cost regarding\nthe amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. The fulfilment cash flows represent the Group’s current best\nestimates and include an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk, known as the risk adjustment. For the Group, as a\nreinsurer, a risk adjustment on the liabilities for incurred claims is not regarded as material. When assessing future cash\nflows, no adjustment is made for the time value of money and the impact of financial risk for incurred claims expected to\nbe settled within one year of being incurred.\n(c) Insurance revenue\nInsurance revenue represents the anticipated premium receipts, excluding any investment component. The Group\nallocates the anticipated premium receipts over the coverage period of the insurance contract services.\n(d) Insurance service expenses\nInsurance service expenses originate from the selling, underwriting, and initiating of a set of insurance contracts, whether\nit is already issued or anticipated.\n\n### 1.28 Related parties\nIndividuals, as well as their close family members, or entities are related parties if one party has the ability, directly or\nindirectly, to control or jointly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial\nand/or operating decisions or if the parties are jointly controlled in a joint venture. Key management personnel are defined as\nall Directors of Shoprite Holdings Ltd and the prescribed officers of the main trading subsidiary (Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd)\nof the Group.\n\n### 1.29 Operating segment information\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities which may earn revenues and incur\nexpenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker (this being the\noperational members of the Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd Board of Directors), in order to allocate resources and assess\nperformance and for which discrete financial information is available.\nOperating segments, which display similar economic characteristics and have similar products, services, customers,\nmethods of distribution and regulatory environments are aggregated for reporting purposes.\nThe Group has the following three reportable segments:\n1. Supermarkets RSA – all retail operations under the Shoprite, Checkers, Checkers Hyper and Usave brands in South\nAfrica, retailing products such as food, clothing, general merchandise, cosmetics and liquor.\n2.

        "text": "1.1 Basis of preparation\nThe Group reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which treats each financial year as an exact 52-week period,\nincorporating trade from Monday to Sunday each week. This treatment effectively results in the loss of a day (or two in a\nleap year) per calendar year. These days are brought to account approximately every six years by including a 53rd week.\nAccordingly, the results for the financial year under review are for a 52-week period, ended 29 June 2025, compared to\n52 weeks in the previous financial year.\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Accounting\nStandards (IFRS® Accounting Standards) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and\nInterpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and comply with the SAICA Financial Reporting\nGuides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial\nReporting Standards Council (FRSC), the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and the requirements of the South African\nCompanies Act, 71 of 2008. The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention adjusted for the\neffects of inflation, where entities operate in hyperinflationary economies, and for the revaluation of certain financial\ninstruments to fair value. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\nThe Ghana economy has been considered to be hyperinflationary. Accordingly, the results, cash flows and financial position\nof the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana have been expressed in terms of the measuring unit applicable at the reporting date.\nThe Angolan economy had been considered to be hyperinflationary up to 30 June 2019. For the 52 weeks ended\n29 June 2025, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be hyperinflationary. Although no further hyperinflationary\nadjustments were required for the current and comparative reporting period of the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, the\nstatement of financial position at the reporting date still includes cumulative hyperinflation adjustments as a result of the\napplication of IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, up to 30 June 2019. These cumulative\nhyperinflation adjustments, included in property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, are written off to the\nstatement of comprehensive income, together with the related deferred income tax effect, in accordance with the Group’s\naccounting policies for the respective items.",

        "text": "1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates\n1.1.1.1 Judgements\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to exercise\nits judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The most significant judgements in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies relate to the following:\n(a) Investment in associate: The Group considers Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd to be a strategic partner and holds a\n49.9% shareholding in the associate. Significant judgement is required in determining whether or not the Group controls\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd. Management determined that control of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd vests in\nits Board of Directors. Equites Property Fund Ltd has a 50.1% shareholding in Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd and\nmay appoint the majority of Directors to the Board of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd. Furthermore, the majority stake\nsubstantive rights inferred includes the ability to appoint key management personnel, the ability to enter into significant\ntransactions and the ability to dominate the nomination of members to the Board of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\nThe founding and operational agreements of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd note that the Group has been\ngranted a number of protective rights and the scope of the activities of Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd has\nbeen partially restricted. Equites Property Fund Ltd has substantive rights to direct these relevant activities of\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\nBased on the assessment done by management it was concluded that Equites Property Fund Ltd controls\nRetail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd and that the Group exercises significant influence over Retail Logistics Fund (RF) (Pty) Ltd.\n(b) Date of acquisition of Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd and Resilient Africa Managers (Pty) Ltd: During the previous financial\nyear, the Group acquired Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd and Resilient Africa Managers (Pty) Ltd. Significant judgement was\nrequired in determining the acquisition date on which the Group obtained control of the entities. The date of acquisition\nwas determined to be the date when the Group assumed the risks and rewards associated with the acquisition, being\nend of March 2024, when the share purchase agreements were signed and both parties unconditionally committed to the\ntransaction.\n22\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(c) Investment in joint venture: The Group previously held a 50% shareholding in Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd, the delivery\npartner for Sixty60 and acquired the remaining 50% share capital during the reporting period. Significant judgement was\nrequired in determining whether the Group controlled Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd. Management determined that control of\nPingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd vested in its Board of Directors. The Board- and sub-committee compositions were equally\nrepresented by the shareholders. These committees made decisions about the relevant activities and the appointment of\nkey management personnel of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\nThe founding and operational agreements of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd note that the Group had been granted a number of\nprotective rights and the scope of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd’s activities has been partially restricted. The shareholders\ntogether had substantive rights to direct the relevant activities of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\nFurther judgement was applied in considering whether the agreement was a joint venture or joint operation. According to\nprojections, Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd would not provide substantially all of its services solely to the Group.\nBased on the assessment done by management, it was concluded that the shareholders jointly controlled\nPingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd and therefore this was accounted for as a joint venture up to the date that the Group\nacquired the remaining share capital of Pingo Delivery (Pty) Ltd.\n(d) Third-party cell captive contracts: Judgement was applied to determine the Group’s eligibility for adopting the premium\nallocation approach, in accordance with IFRS 17. The Group has adopted the premium allocation approach as it\nreasonably expects the measurement relating to its insurance contracts would not differ materially from that produced\nunder the general measurement model, if applied.\n(e) Investment in Shoprite Employee Trust: The Group established Shoprite Employee Trust on a non-vesting, evergreen\nbasis. Significant judgement is required in determining whether or not the Group controls Shoprite Employee Trust. As\nits founder, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd funded the Shoprite Employee Trust primarily on a notional basis upon formation\nof the trust. Aimed at retention and motivation of the Group’s employees in an appropriate manner and ensuring that\nthey benefit from the growth and continued success of the Group, the objective of the scheme implemented by\nShoprite Employee Trust is to provide eligible employees with distributions whenever a dividend is declared by\nShoprite Holdings Ltd to its ordinary shareholders. Such distributions to eligible employees are funded by dividends\nreceived from Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd.\nBased on the assessment done by management, it was concluded that the Group controls Shoprite Employee Trust in\naccordance with IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements, and that the appropriate accounting treatment for this\nentity is for the Group to consolidate its results.\n(f) Classification of cash and bank balances: Local currency cash and short-term deposits held in Angola, Nigeria and\nMalawi are subject to onerous local exchange control regulations, which provide restrictions on exporting capital from the\ncountry, other than through normal dividends. In order to determine how restricted funds should be classified in the cash\nflow statement, it should be considered whether the restricted funds meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents or\nwhether the funds are restricted in a manner such that the definition is not met. Significant judgement is required in this\nassessment. Management assessed the economic substance of the restrictions in each case by taking into consideration\nthe facts and circumstances of the specific restrictions and how management intends to use the deposits. It was\nconcluded that restricted funds that are available for use in the short-term in Angola, Nigeria and Malawi (2024: Angola,\nNigeria and Malawi), albeit with some restrictions over their use, still qualify to be classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nHowever, the deposit accounts in Angola which were held for objections to tax assessments were ring-fenced as they\ncould not be utilised by the Group. These guaranteed amounts were classified as restricted cash on the statement of\nfinancial position. The funds do not form part of the statement of cash flows as the Group does not have access to these\naccounts.\n(g) Lease term: In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic\nincentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after\ntermination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not\nterminated).\nFor leases of distribution centres and retail stores, the following factors are normally the most relevant:\n• The number of extension options included in the initial measurement of the lease liability will depend on the length of\nthe initial period and whether higher-than-normal capital expenditure was incurred on leasehold improvements. For\nsubsequent measurement, the store’s profitability is used to determine if and how many options are to be included\nupon renewal of the lease.\n• Otherwise, the Group considers other factors including the costs and business disruption required to replace the\nleased asset.\nMost extension options in rental contracts for offices and the commercial vehicle fleet have not been included in the lease\nliability, because the Group could replace the assets without significant cost or business disruption.\n23\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(g) Lease term: continued\nThe lease term is reassessed if an extension option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged\nto exercise (or not exercise) it. Extension options are generally exercised six to 12 months before the end of the lease\nterm. When the lease term is adjusted as a result of exercising an extension option not included in the initial measurement\nof the lease liability, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset. The assessment of\nreasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the control\nof the lessee occurs and affects this assessment.\n(h) Discount rate used to calculate the lease liability: Incremental borrowing rates used to calculate lease liabilities at\ninception of the lease are determined monthly and depend on the term, country, currency and start date of the lease. The\nincremental borrowing rate is determined based on a series of inputs including: the risk-free rate based on government\nbond rates; a country-specific risk adjustment; an adjustment for the term of the lease; and an entity-specific adjustment\nwhere the entity risk profile is different to that of the Group.\n(i) Determination of whether a sale and leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale: A sale and leaseback is a transaction\nin which the owner of an asset sells the asset and leases it back from the buyer. The IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) treatment\nof a sale and leaseback transaction hinges on whether the transaction is considered to be a sale or not. Where the Group\nacts as a seller-lessee in this transaction, it must determine if the transaction qualifies as a sale for which revenue is\nrecognised, or whether the transaction is a collateralised borrowing.\nThe assessment of whether the transaction is a sale depends on whether it satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15:\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), in which the buyer-lessor obtains control of the asset. Judgement is\nthus required in analysing whether the transaction constitutes a transfer of control sale in terms of IFRS 15.\nIn terms of IFRS 15, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset) to a\ncustomer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. In determining whether control\nhas transferred to the buyer-lessor, management considers all qualitative facts and prepares a quantitative assessment\nconsidering the proportion of the fair value retained.\n(j) Classification of non-current assets to be sold within 12 months after the reporting date: Management applies\njudgement in determining whether a portfolio of assets and related liabilities should be classified as held for sale. In terms\nof IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS 5), an entity shall classify a disposal\ngroup as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through\ncontinuing use.\nThe Group identified a portfolio of malls to be sold and subsequently leased back from the buyer-lessor (subject to\ncertain conditions). Management applied their judgement and concluded that the carrying amount of the malls would be\nrecovered principally through sale rather than through continued use as the Group retained an insignificant percentage of\nthe fair value of the underlying assets. The portfolio of malls was subsequently classified as assets held for sale as their\ncarrying amounts were recovered principally through a sale transaction.\nDuring the current year the Group signed agreements to dispose of the furniture business (excluding Mozambique), as\nwell as the Group’s operations in Ghana and Malawi. Furthermore an offer was accepted to sell the Group’s subsidiaries,\nAsaba Mall Development Company Ltd and Delta Mall Development Company Ltd that each own an investment property\nin Nigeria. The Group considers it highly probable that these disposal groups will be disposed of and consequently they\nhave been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued\nOperations. Refer to note 4.\n(k) Segment reporting: IFRS 8: Operating Segments requires an entity to identify its operating segments and determine its\nreportable segments. Reportable segments may comprise single operating segments or an aggregation of operating\nsegments. Aggregation of one or more operating segments into a single reportable segment is permitted where certain\nconditions are met; the principle conditions being that the operating segments should have similar economic\ncharacteristics and the operating segments are similar in respect of the products and services offered, nature of\nproduction processes, type or class of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment.\nThe Group’s management has assessed the above mentioned aggregation criteria in respect of its identified retail\noperating segments and believe that it has been satisfied as they have similar average gross margins and similar\nexpected growth rates; therefore it has elected to aggregate the segments as disclosed in note 2.\n(l) Determination of cash-generating units: The Group has determined each store and investment property as a separate\ncash-generating unit for impairment testing.\n(m) Use of exchange rates: All foreign currency translations and foreign currency transactions are translated using the\nofficial exchange rate in line with the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards and foreign exchange regulations in\nindividual countries.\n24\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.1 Judgements continued\n(n) Hyperinflation: The Group exercises judgement in determining the onset of hyperinflation in countries in which it\noperates and whether the functional currency of its subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements is the currency of a\nhyperinflationary economy.\nVarious characteristics of the economic environment of each country are taken into account to assess whether an\neconomy is hyperinflationary or not. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• The general population prefer to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency;\n• Prices are quoted in a relatively stable foreign currency;\n• Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during\nthe credit period, even if the period is short;\n• Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and\n• The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.\nManagement exercises judgement in determining when a restatement of the financial statements of a Group entity\nbecomes necessary.\nGhana\nThe economy of Ghana was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective from 3 July 2023 and hyperinflation accounting\nwas applied for the year ended 29 June 2025. Accordingly, the results and financial position of the Group’s Ghana\nsubsidiary have been expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.\nDuring the current year, the Group signed an agreement to dispose of the operations in Ghana, which have been\nclassified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued\nOperations. Sale of merchandise included in profit from discontinued operations has increased by R395 million (2024:\nR93 million decrease) due to the hyperinflation impact, while prior period gains of R15 million (2024: R124 million gains),\nwhich arose from the net monetary position, were recognised in other comprehensive income from discontinued\noperations.\nThe general price indices, as published by the Ghana Statistical Service, were used in adjusting the historical cost local\ncurrency results and financial position of the Group’s Ghana subsidiary. The general price index as at the end of the\nreporting period was 257.30 (2024: 226.4). As at 29 June 2025, the cumulative three-year inflation rate was 98.8%\n(2024: 127.1%).\nAngola\nThe economy of Angola was reassessed and found to no longer be hyperinflationary. The hyperinflation accounting was\nceased for the current and comparative year and the cumulative hyperinflation adjustments up to 30 June 2019 will\nunwind over time. The Group will continue to monitor the hyperinflationary nature of Angola.\nThe general price indices, as published by the National Institute of Statistics of Angola, were used in adjusting the\nhistoric cost local currency results and financial positions of the Group’s Angolan subsidiaries up to 30 June 2019.\nAs at 29 June 2025, the cumulative three-year inflation rate was 74.5% (2024: 79.2%).\n(o) Agent versus principal assessment of drop-shipments: The IFRS 15 principles dictate that revenue is recognised as\nand when the control over goods and services is transferred to customers. OK Franchise members may order goods for\ndirect delivery in terms of a drop-shipment arrangement with suppliers, which are pre-approved by the Group, at prices\nnegotiated between the Group and the suppliers. The Group has assessed its drop-shipment sales and concluded that\nthe fact that the Group has a contractual relationship with the suppliers, negotiates prices on behalf of its members and\npays the swell allowance for quality issues to the member, indicates that it is acting as principal in these arrangements.\nThe Group’s drop-shipment sales will therefore continue to be recognised on a gross basis having satisfied the\nrequirements of principal accounting under IFRS 15.\n1.1.1.2 Assumptions and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical\naccounting estimates and assumptions. The most significant assumptions and estimates used in applying the Group’s\naccounting policies relate to the following:\n(a) Rebates from suppliers: Management is required to make estimates in determining the amount and timing of recognition\nof rebates for some transactions with suppliers. In determining the amount of volume-related allowances recognised in any\nperiod, management estimates the probability that the Group will meet contractual target volumes, based on historical and\nforecast performance. There is limited estimation involved in recognising income for promotional and other allowances.\nManagement assesses its performance against the obligations conditional on earning the rebate, with the rebate\nrecognised either over time as the obligations are met, or at the point when all obligations are met, dependent on the\ncontractual requirements. Rebates are recognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the rebate earned relates to\ninventories which are held by the Group at period ends, the rebate is included within the cost of those inventories, and\nrecognised in cost of sales upon sale of those inventories. Management views that the cost of inventories sold (which is\ninclusive of rebates) provides a consistent and complete measure of the statement of comprehensive income impact of\nthe overall supplier relationships.\n25\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued\n1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates continued\n1.1.1.2 Assumptions and estimates continued\n(b) Impairment of assets: The Group performs a review of trading stores as well as investment properties and considers the\nneed for the impairment of assets. This determination requires significant judgement. The Group evaluates amongst other\nthings the near-term business outlook, the possible redeployment of assets between stores and the trading duration of\nthe stores. Refer to note 8.\n(c) Useful lives of assets: In determining the depreciation and amortisation charge for property, plant and equipment,\ninvestment properties and intangible assets, management applies judgement in estimating the useful lives and residual\nvalues of these different asset classes. Refer to notes 3, 5, 7, 27 and 46.\n(d) Income taxes: The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in\ndetermining the worldwide accrual for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated uncertain income tax\npositions for either the most likely amount or the expected value (probability weighted average), based on management’s\nestimates of potential additional taxes due. For the period under review, the Group primarily applied the most likely\namount method to calculate the best estimate of potential cash outflows as management expects this method to better\npredict the resolution of the uncertainties. Management apply judgement to estimate the reasonable likelihood\npercentages using the Group’s experiences of historic successful reductions in similar tax matters, taking into\nconsideration advice from independent experts regarding the merits of each dispute. With regards to deferred income tax\nassets for unutilised income tax losses, judgement is also required to determine whether sufficient future taxable income\nwill be available against which these losses can be utilised. Refer to notes 1.24 and 14.\n(e) Allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets: The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the\nECL associated for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and the Group recognises an\nallowance for ECL on these financial assets. The measurement of the ECL allowance is an area that requires the use of\ncomplex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The ECL\nallowances on financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses\nits judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculations, based on the Group’s\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of the\nkey assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in note 43.4.1.\n(f) Third-party cell captive contracts: Third-party cell captive contracts are measured using the premium allocation\napproach which simplifies the measurement of the net asset for remaining coverage and liabilities for incurred claims.\nRefer to notes 1.27, 11 and 43.5 for details of key assumptions and estimates applied.\n(g) Net realisable value of inventory: Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories are\nphysically verified through the performance of inventory counts in all stores and distribution centres at least once a year,\nwhilst cycle counts are performed daily. Shortages identified during stock takes and daily cycle counts are written off\nimmediately.\nThe Group provides for shrinkage and write-downs below cost to ensure that inventory is carried at net realisable value.\nThe provision for net realisable value of inventory represents management’s estimate of the extent to which merchandise\non hand at the reporting date will be sold below cost. The provision for shrinkage applies the historic shrinkage\npercentage to sales between the most recent inventory count and the reporting date. Refer to note 16.\n(h) Employee benefit accruals and provisions: Various assumptions are applied in determining the valuations of post-\nemployment medical benefits, share-based payment accruals and long-term employee benefits as set out in notes 1.17,\n1.18, 18 and 22.\nEstimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities in a subsequent year relate to the following: impairment of assets; income taxes; expected credit losses and\nemployee benefit allowances.\nAll estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that management\nbelieves are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis of judgements about the\ncarrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and any affected future periods.\n26\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.1 Basis of preparation continued",

        "text": "1.2.1 Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by the Group. Control is\nestablished where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the\nability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The nature and effect of existing rights that give the Group the\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another\nentity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer\nconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured at the fair\nvalue of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition.\nIdentifiable assets acquired as well as liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured\ninitially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.

The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share of the\nidentifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill.

        "text": "1.12.1 Where the Group is the lessee\n(a) Leasing activities and how they are accounted for\nThe Group leases various offices, distribution centres, retail stores, vehicles and equipment. Rental contracts are typically\nentered into for fixed periods, with extension options as follows:\n• Properties: five to 10 years, with extension options for a further 15 to 20 years.\n• Commercial vehicle fleet: one to 12 years, with an option to renew.\n• Multifunctional printers: three years, with month to month extension options.\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to\nthe lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. Non-lease components are expensed as\nthey become due.\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease\nagreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.\nLeased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.\nA right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date at which the leased asset is available\nfor use by the Group. They are initially measured on a present value basis.\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n• Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n• Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the\ncommencement date;\n• The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n• Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\nThe Group’s current rental portfolio does not include termination penalties. However, should these become relevant in the\nfuture, such payments will also be included in the initial measurement of the lease liability.\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not\nincluded in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take\neffect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the\nlessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the\nfunds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with\nsimilar terms, security and conditions. The Group discounts lease payments for its commercial vehicle fleet using the\ninterest rate implicit in the lease. All other lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.\n32\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.12 Leases continued\n1.12.1 Where the Group is the lessee continued\n(a) Leasing activities and how they are accounted for continued\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:\n• Where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to\nreflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;\n• Uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the lessee,\nwhich does not have recent third-party financing; and\n• Makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease payments\nare allocated between principal and finance costs. Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as\nto produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n• The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n• Any lease prepayments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\n• Any initial direct costs;\n• Restoration costs; and\n• Subsequent remeasurement of the lease liability.\nAfter initial recognition the cost of the right-of-use asset is adjusted to include the subsequent remeasurement of the\nlease liability. Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the underlying asset’s useful life and the\nlease term on a straight-line basis. In instances where the ownership transfers from the lessor to the lessee, the right-of-\nuse assets are depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, right-of-use\nassets relating to this subsidiary are restated by applying the change in the general price indices from the date of\nacquisition to the current reporting date (refer to note 1.5).\nPayments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets (with a cost\nprice below R75 000) are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases\nwith a lease term of 12 months or less.\n(b) Variable lease payments\nSome property leases (2025: 53.3%; 2024: 52.8%) contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from\na store. Turnover rentals, where applicable, average 2.2% (2024: 2.1%) of turnover. Variable payment terms are used for a\nvariety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease payments that\ndepend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\nA 10% increase in sales across all stores in the Group with such variable lease contracts would increase total lease\npayments by approximately R55 million (2024: R53 million).\n(c) Extension and termination options\nThe lease term includes any non-cancellable periods and reasonably certain termination or extension option periods.\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and commercial vehicle fleet leases across the\nGroup. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations.\nThe majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.\nThe average lease term of the Group’s portfolio of qualifying leases are as follows:\n2025 2024\nDistribution centres 9.6 years 9.9 years\nStorage and warehousing 4.7 years 4.6 years\nOther properties 8.7 years 8.5 years\nCommercial vehicle fleet 5.0 years 5.0 years\nMultifunctional printers 3.0 years 3.0 years\n33\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.12 Leases continued",

All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the\nsublease classification is assessed with reference to the head lease right-of-use asset.\nFinance leases\nAt the commencement date of a sublease agreement, the right-of-use asset of the head lease is derecognised, and the\nGroup recognises a net investment in lease receivables. The net investment in lease receivables is measured as the present\nvalue of the lease payments to be received over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the\ninterest rate implicit in the sublease cannot be readily determined, the discount rate for the head lease is used. Any\ndifference between the right-of-use asset and net investment in lease receivables is recognised in profit or loss.\nThe lease liabilities of the head leases are accounted for in terms of note 1.12.1.\nNet investment in lease receivables is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\nLease payments received are allocated between principal and finance income. Finance income is charged to profit or loss\nover the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the receivable for\neach period.\nNet investment in lease receivables is assessed for impairment at each reporting date as financial assets in accordance with\nnote 1.14.5.\nOperating leases\nPortions of owner-occupied properties and leased properties are leased or subleased out under operating leases. The\nowner-occupied properties are included in property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position. Rental\nincome in respect of operating leases with a fixed escalation clause is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Incentives received to enter into a lease agreement are released to the statement of comprehensive income as\noperating lease income over the lease term. All other rental income is recognised as it becomes due.\nWhen an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment received from the lessee by way of\npenalty is recognised as income and any unamortised portion of the fixed escalation lease accrual is recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income in the period in which termination takes place.",

A sale occurs when control of the underlying asset passes to the buyer. This accounting\npolicy thus applies in instances where the Group, as the seller-lessee, has transferred control of the asset to the buyer-lessor\nin terms of an IFRS 15 sale.\nAs the Group is the lessee in the subsequent arrangement, a lease liability is recognised, the associated property, plant and\nequipment asset is derecognised, and a right-of-use asset is recognised at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of\nthe asset relating to the right-of-use retained. The gain (or loss) that the seller-lessee recognises is limited to the proportion\nof the total gain (or loss) that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. Any difference between the sale\nconsideration and the fair value of the asset is either a prepayment of lease payments (if the purchase price is below market\nterms) or an additional financing (if the purchase price is above market terms). Any gain or loss that relates to the rights\ntransferred to the buyer-lessor is recorded within items of a capital nature.\nIn other instances, where there is no transfer of control, the transaction amounts to a collateralised borrowing, which is\ncovered by the existing accounting policies pertaining to financial liabilities as described in note 1.14.",

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual\ncash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, using\nthe effective interest rate method, less allowance made for impairment of these assets.\nInterest income from these financial assets is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount,\nexcept for:\n• Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. For these financial assets the Group applies the credit-adjusted\neffective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition; and\n• Financial assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets but subsequently have become\ncredit-impaired financial assets. For these financial assets, the Group applies the effective interest rate to the amortised\ncost of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.\nInitiation fees, which are considered to be an integral part of the effective interest rate, are accounted for over the shorter of\nthe original contractual term and the actual term of the loan or credit sale using the effective interest rate.\nAny gain or loss arising on derecognition, modification or impairment is recognised directly in profit or loss.\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those financial assets\nchanges.\nThe following debt investments are measured at amortised cost in terms of the Group’s business model of holding these\nfinancial assets to collect solely payments of principal and interest:\n(a) Government bonds and bills: These financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable\nprincipal and interest payments and fixed maturities for which the Group intends to hold them to maturity to collect\ncontractual cash flows. Government bonds and bills are included under non-current assets unless it matures within\n12 months after the reporting date. Interest on government bonds and bills is recognised in the statement of\ncomprehensive income as interest revenue.\n(b) Loans receivable: Loans receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not\nquoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no\nintention of trading the receivable. The Group holds the loans receivable with the objective to collect contractual cash\nflows and the contractual terms of the loans receivable are solely payments of principal and interest. These financial\nassets are included under current assets unless it matures later than 12 months after the reporting date. Interest on loans\nreceivable is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as interest revenue.\n(c) Trade and other receivables: Trade receivables consist mainly of amounts receivable for the sale of merchandise to\nfranchisees, medical aid schemes, pharmacies, doctors and buying aid societies. Furthermore, the Group has entered\ninto various instalment sale agreements for household furniture. Other receivables consist of various operational debtors\nsuch as rental and municipal deposits refundable and insurance claims receivable. A finance sublease agreement was\nentered into previously and is included as a net investment in lease receivables. Trade and other receivables are held to\ncollect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the trade and other receivables are solely payments of\nprincipal and interest. Interest on trade and other receivables is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as\ninterest revenue.\n(d) Restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities: Cash comprises cash\non hand and cash at banks. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to\nknown amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Interest on cash and cash equivalents\nis recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as interest received from bank account balances. Restricted\ncash, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial\nposition.\n35\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n1.14 Other financial instruments continued\n1.14.4 Classification and subsequent measurement continued\nFinancial assets held at FVOCI\n(e) Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income: Investments at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income include equity shares of non-listed companies. The Group holds a non-controlling interest in these\ncompanies. At initial recognition, the Group has irrevocably elected to classify these strategic investments as financial\nassets held at FVOCI. At the reporting date the fair value is determined based on the net asset value of the companies.\nFinancial assets held at FVPL\nThe following financial assets are measured at FVPL as they do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI:\n(f) First-party insurance cell captive arrangements: The first-party insurance cell captive arrangements are measured at\nFVPL on initial recognition. At the reporting date the fair value is determined based on the net asset value of the\nunderlying cell captive arrangements.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The\neffective interest rate amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as finance costs.\nFinancial liabilities, other than lease liabilities, measured at amortised cost on the statement of financial position include\nborrowings, trade and other payables, bank overdrafts and other short-term facilities:\n(g) Borrowings: Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the unconditional right to defer\nsettlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Refer to note 1.21 for the Group’s accounting\npolicy with regards to the capitalisation of borrowing costs.\n(h) Trade and other payables: Trade and other payables mainly comprise trade payables for the purchase of merchandise\nfor resale and are short-term in nature.\nNon-convertible, non-participating, non-transferable no par value deferred shares, which are mandatorily acquirable on a\nspecific date, are classified as other payables.",

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting\nperiod whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\nIn the event of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the Group recognises an allowance (or\nprovision) for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).\nFinancial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be ’stage 1’; financial assets which are considered\nto have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ’stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective\nevidence of impairment are considered to be in default, or otherwise credit-impaired, are in ’stage 3’.\nThe measurement of ECL under the general impairment approach reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value\nof money and the best forward-looking information available to the Group. The probability-weighted outcome\nincorporates the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), timing of when default is likely to occur and loss\ngiven default (LGD).\n36\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.14 Other financial instruments continued\n1.14.5 Impairment continued\n(b) Simplified approach\nFor instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables with a significant financing component, the Group has elected\nto measure the impairment allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL. This policy will be applied to all instalment\nsale and net investment in lease receivables.\nThe measurement of ECL under the simplified impairment approach reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time\nvalue of money and the best forward-looking information available to the Group.\n(c) Provision matrix\nFor trade and other receivables without a significant financing component, the Group applies the simplified approach\nwhich recognises lifetime ECL. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on historical payment profiles\nand credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to such trade and other receivables and the\neconomic environment.\nThe Group recognises in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or reversal, the amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to\nadjust the loss allowance at the end of the reporting period. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the\nallowance for impairment for that receivable. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income.\nNote 43.4.1 provides more detail on how the Group determines a significant increase in credit risk and how the expected\ncredit loss allowance is measured.",

Income tax is recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case\nit will also be recognised directly in equity.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, for calculated income tax losses and temporary differences\narising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. However,\nthe deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other\nthan a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the\nreporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax\nliability is settled.\n40\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n1.24 Current and deferred income tax continued\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against\nwhich temporary differences can be utilised. Management applies judgement to determine whether sufficient future taxable\nprofit will be available after considering, amongst others, factors such as profit histories, forecasted cash flows and budgets.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries,\nassociates and joint arrangements, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by\nthe Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required to determine whether an obligation should be\nrecognised as a liability or disclosed as a contingent liability (refer to note 39). There are many transactions and calculations\nduring the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination can be uncertain for a considerable period of\ntime, requiring management to estimate the related income tax positions. Significant judgement is therefore required in\ndetermining the worldwide accrual for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated uncertain income tax\npositions based on management’s best informed estimates, when it is probable that additional taxes will be due. To measure\nthe liabilities for uncertain tax positions, management determines whether uncertainties need to be considered separately or\ntogether based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Where the final income tax outcome of\nthese matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax\nand deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Pillar Two rules were enacted in South Africa on 24 December 2024 and is retrospectively effective from 1 January 2024\nfor groups with fiscal years commencing on or after that date. The Group determined that the global minimum top-up tax\nwould be an income tax within the scope of IAS12. The Group will be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its\neffective tax rate per jurisdiction in terms of the Pillar Two rules and the 15% minimum rate.\nThe Group has elected to apply the temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax and therefore has not determined the\nimpact of Pillar Two on deferred tax in accordance with the amendments to IAS12 issued in May 2023.\nThe Group has performed an assessment of its potential exposure in relation to the Pillar Two legislation for the 2025\nfinancial year. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the Group does not anticipate being subject to a material top-up\ntax exposure in any of the jurisdiction in which it operates.\nAs the functional currency of the Group’s subsidiary in Ghana is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy, deferred income\ntax relating to this subsidiary is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their restated carrying amounts (refer to note 1.5).",

All\nreferences made to insurance contracts apply equally to reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group.\nContracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to\ncompensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the\npolicyholder or other beneficiary, are classified as insurance contracts.\nAn insurance risk is deemed significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional\nbenefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance.

Cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract refer to cash flows that arise from substantive rights\nand obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the policyholder is obligated by the Group to pay the\npremiums, or in which the Group has a substantive obligation to render insurance contract services to the policyholder.\nThe premium allocation approach is applied to all insurance contracts entered into by the Group. The asset for remaining\ncoverage is measured as the difference between premiums received at initial recognition, and any insurance acquisition\ncash flows at the date of inception of the contract. Where the coverage period is one year or less the insurance\nacquisition cash flows are expensed. For contracts with a coverage period of more than one year the insurance\nacquisition cash flows are capitalised and then amortised. The carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage is\nmeasured as:\n• The sum of all capital contributions received;\n• Less insurance acquisition expenses;\n• Less dividends paid by the cell; and\n• Plus insurance revenue recognised in respect of services provided during the reporting period.\nThe liabilities for incurred claims are estimated as the fulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims and incurred\nexpenses. These cash flows consider all reasonable and supportable information available at a reasonable cost regarding\nthe amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. The fulfilment cash flows represent the Group’s current best\nestimates and include an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk, known as the risk adjustment. For the Group, as a\nreinsurer, a risk adjustment on the liabilities for incurred claims is not regarded as material. When assessing future cash\nflows, no adjustment is made for the time value of money and the impact of financial risk for incurred claims expected to\nbe settled within one year of being incurred.\n(c) Insurance revenue\nInsurance revenue represents the anticipated premium receipts, excluding any investment component. The Group\nallocates the anticipated premium receipts over the coverage period of the insurance contract services.\n(d) Insurance service expenses\nInsurance service expenses originate from the selling, underwriting, and initiating of a set of insurance contracts, whether\nit is already issued or anticipated.",

Refer to note 45 for details of the adjustments recognised for each individual line item.\nThe impairment charges largely resulted from a reduction in the cash flow projections of certain stores, the bulk of which is\ndue to the challenging trading environment in key markets where the Group trades. In addition to the aforementioned, the\nhigher commodity prices experienced in the commodity dependent regions also contributed to the impairment charges.\n\n### 8.2 Impairment methodology\nCash-generating units\nThe Group treats each store as a separate CGU for impairment testing of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets\nand intangible assets, other than goodwill. Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs, or a group of CGUs, to which the\ngoodwill relates. Each investment property is treated as a separate CGU.\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and its fair value less costs of disposal. The\nrecoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated, is determined based on value-in-\nuse calculations.\nCentral corporate assets such as home office, regional offices and distribution centres, together with their associated\nincome and costs are allocated to CGUs with reference to sales.\nEach CGU is assessed at the reporting date to determine if any indicators of impairment have been identified.\n52\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n8.2 Impairment methodology continued\nValue-in-use\nThe cash flow projections used in value-in-use calculations are based on financial budgets, approved by management,\ncovering five-year planning periods. Cash flow projections are derived from an analysis of historic performance and\nknowledge of the current market, together with the Group’s views on the future achievable growth and the impact of\ncommitted initiatives, the results of which are reviewed by management. Cash flows beyond these planning periods are\nextrapolated into the future over the useful life of the CGU, using a steady long-term growth rate which is derived from\ninflation forecasts by recognised bodies and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry and country\nin which the CGUs operate.\nIn determining the value-in-use of each CGU, projected cash flows are discounted using the entity-specific pre-tax discount\nrate which includes an adjustment for risks, specific to the country in which a CGU operates.\nFair value less costs of disposal\nIn determining the fair value less costs of disposal of affected land, buildings and investment properties (level 3 within the\nfair value hierarchy), cash flow projections based on projected net market-related rentals covering the next planning period\nwere used.\n\n### 8.3 Key assumptions and sensitivity analyses\nThe key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the expected trading profit growth rates, long-term growth rates\nand the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rates. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s weighted average cost\nof capital, taking into account the cost of capital, lease liabilities and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium\nadjustments are made for each country.\nFor fair value less costs of disposal calculations of land, buildings and investment properties the key assumption is the\nmarket capitalisation rate used.\nThe following table sets out the key assumptions applied in determining the recoverable amount of each CGU, summarised\nby geographical region:\nTrading profit Long-term Market\nDiscount rate growth rate growth rate capitalisation rate\n2025 2024 2025 2024 2025 2024 2025 2024\n% % % % % % % %\nSouth Africa 11.4 11.8 6.4 6.2 6.4 6.2 7.25 – 11.0 7.5 – 11.0\nAngola 32.9 37.8 20.0 22.4 20.0 22.4 19.0 19.0\nBotswana 11.0 9.9 7.6 8.4 7.6 8.4 — —\nGhana 24.0 19.5 15.4 14.8 15.4 14.8 13.0 19.0\nMalawi 33.5 39.2 15.6 15.2 15.6 15.2 13.0 19.0\nMozambique 26.2 26.4 10.0 12.0 10.0 12.0 19.0 19.0\nNamibia 16.1 14.3 8.7 8.1 8.7 8.1 11.0 11.0\nSwaziland 17.0 17.9 7.3 6.2 7.3 6.2 — —\nZambia 23.2 22.6 12.6 12.4 12.6 12.4 13.0 13.0\nThe forecast trading profit growth rates, risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates for CGUs and\ngroups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are as follows:\nTrading profit Long-term\ngrowth rate Discount rate growth rate\n2025 2024 2025 2024 2025 2024\n% % % % % %\nSupermarket operations 5.5 – 6.6 4.1 – 6.1 11.4 – 17.0 11.8 – 17.9 6.4 – 7.3 6.2\nOther operations 5.1 9.2 11.4 11.8 6.4 6.2\nManagement has performed sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions in the impairment model using reasonable possible\nchanges in these key assumptions based on recent market movements including discount rates, sales growth and long-\nterm growth rates:\n• An increase of one percentage point in the discount rates for each geographical region would increase the impairment\nby R32 million (2024: R131 million).

These incentives support business as usual delivery against annual and three-year\nperformance targets.\n\n### 18.1 Equity-settled share-based payments\nThe Group offers long-term incentives in the form of rights to ordinary shares of Shoprite Holdings Ltd through participation\nin the Shoprite Holdings Ltd Executive Share Plan (ESP) (previously virtual option bonus plan), executive deferred incentive\n(EDI) and the deferred short-term incentive plan (DSTI) (previously long-term incentive bonus plan).\nShares granted in terms of the ESP, EDI and DSTI, as well as the previous virtual option bonus and long-term incentive\nbonus plans, meet the definition of equity-settled share-based payments. The rights to the shares granted entitle the\nparticipants to receive Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares on vesting at an exercise price of nil. The shares are acquired\nin the market at the grant date and are held as treasury shares until they are vested. The Company’s main trading\nsubsidiary, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd, purchased 1 422 128, (2024: 749 454) Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares in\nrelation to shares granted during the year. The ownership of these shares vests with Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd until\nvesting conditions are met by the participants. The participants are entitled to the dividends and voting rights in relation to\nthe shares granted during the vesting period. The vesting conditions are set out hereafter.\nRefer to note 28.1 for the expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as employee benefits. The\nreconciliation of amounts recorded in the share-based payment reserve is presented in note 19.1.1.\n65\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n18.1 Equity-settled share-based payments continued\nESP\nEmployees that participate in the ESP may be eligible for performance shares, retention shares and/or co-investment\nshares. These shares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances)\nare met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will\nlapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of the ESP shares.\nESP performance shares: Performance conditions, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are attached to these\nshares. Vesting is dependent on the achievement of the performance criteria by the vesting date and the employee meeting\nthe service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nESP co-investment shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is dependent on the\nemployee meeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. As an\nadditional vesting condition, the employee is required to acquire and hold Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares, without\nany encumbrance, for the entire vesting period. During the prior financial year, the Group decided to no longer grant these\nco-investment shares.\nESP retention shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the\nemployee meeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nEDI\nSHL ordinary shares are awarded to senior management under the Employee Deferred Incentive (EDI) scheme in exchange\nfor services received from employees, based on the achievement of short-term incentive criteria. Performance is evaluated\nat the end of the first year to determine the quantum of shares to be awarded, contingent upon meeting the established\nperformance targets. Vesting of EDI is then deferred for a further two years. If the employees do not fulfil the vesting\nconditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect\nof those shares.\nDSTI\nUnder the Group’s deferred short-term incentive plan, employees may be eligible for shares, based on the achievement of\nshort-term incentive criteria for the reporting period. The rights are granted at the end of September of the following\nfinancial year. There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. These shares vest\nthree years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee\ndoes not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will\nlose all rights in respect of these shares.\nAt the grant date, employees may elect to settle their unvested benefits earned in respect of the previous year in shares.\nThe Group therefore grants shares to management in the form of forfeitable retention share awards, resulting in a\nmodification of a cash bonus arrangement to a share-based payment arrangement, as a portion of incentive bonuses\npreviously allocated to management in terms of the deferred short-term incentive plan is converted to shares in Shoprite\nHoldings Ltd. The Group recognises a modification of a cash bonus arrangement in respect of these deferred short-term\nincentives and transfers the liability as at the modification date from provisions to the share-based payment reserve within\nequity. The vesting conditions and vesting periods are not affected by this modification.\nVirtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans\nThe virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans have been replaced by the ESP and deferred short-term\nincentive plan respectively during the year ended 28 June 2020. The previous virtual option bonus and long-term incentive\nbonus plans operated in the same manner as the new deferred short-term incentive plan, with the exception of different\nvesting periods as determined under the virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans. These shares vest in\nequal thirds over a three-, four- and five-year period from the grant date, if vesting conditions (subject to certain special\ncircumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances,\nthe award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.\n66\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n18.1 Equity-settled share-based payments continued\n\n### 18.1.1 ESP performance shares\nReconciliation of

The\nreconciliation of amounts recorded in the share-based payment reserve is presented in note 19.1.1.\n65\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n18.1 Equity-settled share-based payments continued\nESP\nEmployees that participate in the ESP may be eligible for performance shares, retention shares and/or co-investment\nshares. These shares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances)\nare met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will\nlapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of the ESP shares.\nESP performance shares: Performance conditions, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are attached to these\nshares. Vesting is dependent on the achievement of the performance criteria by the vesting date and the employee meeting\nthe service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nESP co-investment shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is dependent on the\nemployee meeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. As an\nadditional vesting condition, the employee is required to acquire and hold Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares, without\nany encumbrance, for the entire vesting period. During the prior financial year, the Group decided to no longer grant these\nco-investment shares.\nESP retention shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the\nemployee meeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nEDI\nSHL ordinary shares are awarded to senior management under the Employee Deferred Incentive (EDI) scheme in exchange\nfor services received from employees, based on the achievement of short-term incentive criteria. Performance is evaluated\nat the end of the first year to determine the quantum of shares to be awarded, contingent upon meeting the established\nperformance targets. Vesting of EDI is then deferred for a further two years. If the employees do not fulfil the vesting\nconditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect\nof those shares.\nDSTI\nUnder the Group’s deferred short-term incentive plan, employees may be eligible for shares, based on the achievement of\nshort-term incentive criteria for the reporting period. The rights are granted at the end of September of the following\nfinancial year. There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. These shares vest\nthree years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee\ndoes not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will\nlose all rights in respect of these shares.\nAt the grant date, employees may elect to settle their unvested benefits earned in respect of the previous year in shares.\nThe Group therefore grants shares to management in the form of forfeitable retention share awards, resulting in a\nmodification of a cash bonus arrangement to a share-based payment arrangement, as a portion of incentive bonuses\npreviously allocated to management in terms of the deferred short-term incentive plan is converted to shares in Shoprite\nHoldings Ltd. The Group recognises a modification of a cash bonus arrangement in respect of these deferred short-term\nincentives and transfers the liability as at the modification date from provisions to the share-based payment reserve within\nequity. The vesting conditions and vesting periods are not affected by this modification.\nVirtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans\nThe virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans have been replaced by the ESP and deferred short-term\nincentive plan respectively during the year ended 28 June 2020. The previous virtual option bonus and long-term incentive\nbonus plans operated in the same manner as the new deferred short-term incentive plan, with the exception of different\nvesting periods as determined under the virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans. These shares vest in\nequal thirds over a three-, four- and five-year period from the grant date, if vesting conditions (subject to certain special\ncircumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances,\nthe award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.\n66\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n18.1 Equity-settled share-based payments continued",

The agreement is\npending the fulfilment of conditions precedent which includes South African Competition Commission approval. The\npurchase consideration will be determined at the closing date of the transaction.\nDue to the Group’s decision to dispose of the majority of the furniture business, a strategic decision was made to abandon\nthe furniture Mozambique operations as the region was excluded from the scope of the sale transaction.

Furthermore, the Group received an indicative binding offer in\nJune 2025 to dispose of the Angola furniture business, the sale is deemed highly probable and has therefore been\nclassified as discontinued operations in terms of IFRS 5. The purchase consideration will be determined at the closing\ndate of the transaction.\nShoprite Trading Ltd\nOn 6 June 2025 the Group signed an agreement to dispose of the assets in relation to the operations in Malawi that consist\nof five trading stores. The agreement is pending the fulfilment of conditions precedent which includes Competition and Fair\nTrading commission and Reserve Bank Malawi approval. The full purchase consideration will be determined at the closing\ndate of the transaction.\nShoprite Ghana Ltd\nIn June 2025 the Group received an binding offer to dispose of the assets and liabilities in relation to the operations in\nGhana, which consists of seven trading stores and one warehouse.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify risks faced by\nthe Group and establish appropriate controls and limits to mitigate the risk to acceptable levels. The Audit and Risk\nCommittee oversees how management monitors compliance with these risk and control policies.\nThis note discloses information about the Group’s capital risk management and exposure to risks from its use of financial\ninstruments. It also discloses information about the Group’s exposure to insurance risk and how it is mitigated.\n\n### 43.1 Capital risk management\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order\nto provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to\nreduce the cost of capital. Total capital is considered to be equity as shown in the statement of financial position.\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,\nreturn capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The gearing ratio is calculated as interest-\nbearing borrowings and lease liabilities divided by equity and was 179.3% (2024: 167.6%) at the reporting date.\nThe Group is currently maintaining a 1.75 times (2024: 1.75 times) dividend cover based on diluted headline earnings per\nshare from continuing operations.\n\n### 43.2 Fair value of financial instruments\nAll financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that reflects the\nsignificance of the inputs used in determining the measurement. The hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Measurements in whole or in part are done by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for\nidentical assets and liabilities. Quoted prices are readily available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing\nservice or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s\nlength basis.\nLevel 2: Measurements are done by reference to inputs other than quoted prices that are included in level 1. These inputs\nare observable for the financial instrument, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. from derived prices).\nLevel 3: Measurements are done by reference to inputs that are not based on observable market data.\nThe Group’s investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 10) and Centriq Insurance Company Ltd\nfirst-party cell captive insurance arrangements (note 11.2) are measured at fair value and classified at level 3. The fair value\nis based on the net asset value at the statement of financial position date.

annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n\n### 43.4 Financial risk management\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in debt, foreign currency\nexchange rates and interest rates. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of\nfinancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group\nuses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange rate contracts and price swap contracts as economic\nhedges, to hedge certain exposures. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied, using non-derivative\nfinancial instruments, to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s\noperating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering\nspecific areas, such as foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and\ninvesting excess liquidity.\n\n### 43.4.1 Credit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual\nobligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual\ncharacteristics of each counterparty. Potential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of investment in insurance cell\ncaptive arrangements, government bonds and bills, loans receivable, trade and other receivables, restricted cash as well as\ncash and cash equivalents.\nThe following impairment losses, including reversals of impairment losses, in relation to financial assets are presented as\ncredit impairment losses in the statement of comprehensive income:\n2025 2024\nRm Rm\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) (9) 202\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) 34 30\nGovernment bonds and bills (note 12) (14) (5)\nLoans receivable (note 13) 35 155\nOther receivables (note 15.3) 21 (1)\nNet impairment losses on financial assets in relation to financial assets 67 381\nCredit impairment losses/(reversal of impairment losses) classified as:\nContinuing operations 76 179\nDiscontinued operations (9) 202\n67 381\nThe Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs,\nassumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\nhas occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. ECL are the discounted\nproduct of the probability of default (PD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n• The PD represents the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month\nPD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.\n• The EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default over the next 12 months\n(12-month EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime EAD).\n• The Group calculates loss given default (LGD) as discounted EAD.\nThese three components are multiplied together. This effectively calculates the ECL which is then discounted back to the\nreporting date, using the original effective interest rate, and aggregated. ECL is a probability-weighted outcome.\nThe 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the PD, which varies by type of financial asset.\n100\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nSICR in terms of the general model for impairment\nThe Group considers financial assets subject to assessment for ECL in terms of the general model for impairment, to have\nexperienced a SICR since the time of initial recognition, when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or\nbackstop criteria have been met. The SICR assessment happens on a bi-annual basis per financial asset class, at a\nportfolio level. The criteria used to identify SICR are monitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the credit\nrisk team.\nQuantitative criteria\nWhere the counterparty has not met its minimum contractual obligations for at least one month.\nQualitative criteria\nThe Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Especially the following indicators\nare incorporated:\n• Internal and external credit ratings;\n• Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause\na significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;\n• Changes in general economic and/or market conditions;\n• Changes in the amount of financial support available to the counterparty;\n• Expected or potential breaches of covenants; and\n• Expected delay in payment.\nA backstop is applied if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the simplified model\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified model and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime\nECL. This policy has been applied to all instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables. Lifetime ECL are assessed\nby determining cash flows on a probability-weighted basis and discounting these at the effective interest rate including\ninitiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the following:\n• Transition matrix and conditional probabilities; and\n• Payment performance for each payment state.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the provision matrix\nFor short-term trade receivables, e.g. trade receivables without a significant financing component, the determination of\nforward-looking economic scenarios may be less significant given that over the credit risk exposure period a significant\nchange in economic conditions may be unlikely, and historical loss rates might be an appropriate basis for the estimate of\nexpected future losses. The Group has elected to apply the provision matrix for trade receivables without a significant\nfinancing component and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Lifetime ECL are\nassessed by applying the relevant loss rates to the trade receivable balances outstanding (i.e. a trade receivable age\nanalysis). Due to the diversity of the Group’s customer base, the Group used appropriate groupings if the historical credit\nloss experience showed significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.\n101\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nDefinition of default and credit-impaired assets\nThe Group defines a financial instrument as in default when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within\n90 days of when they fall due. This is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired assets.\nWith regard to credit-impaired accounts, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the\namortised cost, i.e. gross carrying amount less impairment provision, resulting in lower interest revenue.\nThe criteria for credit-impaired accounts (i.e. when the account moves to stage 3 as a result of loss events that have\noccurred after initial recognition) are as follows:\nReceivables arising from contracts with customers:\n• In duplum (the National Credit Act section providing that all charges ceases to accrue once the sum of the charges\nequals the amount of capital outstanding at the time);\n• Debt counselling accounts (as governed by the National Credit Act);\n• Non-performing accounts; and\n• As a backstop, accounts not included in the above categories, where no payment has been received over the last three\nconsecutive months.\nGovernment bonds and bills and loans receivable:\n• Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;\n• Where a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations; and\n• The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.\nOther receivables:\nWhere a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations for three consecutive months.\nCuring\nA credit-impaired account will cure when the customer does not meet the criteria for being a credit-impaired account. For a\ncustomer to cure, a significant improvement in the customer’s payment behaviour is required. Curing occurs in the following\ninstances:\nGovernment bonds and bills:\nWhen the outlook on the Angolan and Nigeria economy, according to major rating agencies, improves from negative to\nbeing stable or positive. This typically happens when the external credit rating improves from initial recognition or the\nprevious reporting period from a rating below BBB- to a rating between AAA and BBB-.\nLoans receivable:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a contractual\nrepayment. If a loan receivable was determined to be credit-impaired, based on the significant difficulty of the counterparty,\nit will cure once there is clear evidence of financial stability from the counterparty.\nInstalment sale receivables:\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a monthly\ninstalment.\n• Accounts in debt counselling will cure when the customer is no longer in debt counselling in terms of the requirements of\nthe National Credit Act.\n• Non-performing accounts will only cure when their lifetime payment rating improves to the extent that the customer has\npaid 55% or more of the amounts due over the contract period. Generally, this will require a significant improvement in\nthe customer’s payment behaviour.\nTrade receivables:\n• In duplum accounts will cure when they no longer meet the requirements of the National Credit Act for being defined as\nan in duplum account.\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nOther receivables:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\n102\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nWrite-off policy\nThe Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has\nconcluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. This is usually the case when the Group’s in-house collection\ndepartment and external collection companies which supplement the Group’s collection activities are unable to recover\noutstanding balances. Where instalment sale receivables have been written off, the Group may continue to attempt to\nrecover the outstanding amount due.\n(a) Government bonds and bills (note 12)\nThe Group invests in Angola government bonds and treasury bills as well as Nigeria treasury bills. The investment in\nAngola government bonds and treasury bills form part of its hedging strategy against a future foreign exchange\ndevaluation in Angola. The majority of the Angola government bonds are linked to the US dollar, which provides a natural\nhedge against US dollar short-term intergroup loans payable by the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, while the remaining\ngovernment bonds and bills provide high returns.\nNone of the government bonds and bills are past due. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.\nThe table below reflects the maximum exposure to credit risk on government bonds and bills at the reporting date.\n2025 2024\nBasis for\nInternal recognition Gross ECL Carrying Gross ECL Carrying\ncredit rating of ECL Financial instrument ECL amount allowance amount ECL amount allowance amount\ncategory allowance class rate Rm Rm Rm rate Rm Rm Rm\nUnder- Lifetime AOA, USD Index\nperforming ECL Linked, Angola\n(stage 2) Government\nBonds 2.2% 551 (12) 539 2.3% 527 (12) 515\nAOA, Angola\nGovernment\nBonds 2.9% 34 (1) 33 5.0% 303 (15) 288\nAngola Treasury\nBills 0.0% — — — 1.5% 67 (1) 66\nNigeria Treasury\nBills 0.0% — — — 5.6% 18 (1) 17\nTotal government bonds and bills 585 (13) 572 915 (29) 886\nInternal credit rating categories are defined as follows with reference to external credit ratings published by Moody’s for\nAngola and Nigeria:\n• Performing (stage 1): Counterparty has a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows\nbased on external credit ratings ranging between AAA and A+.\n• Underperforming (stage 2): Investments for which there is a SICR.

The underlying PD (including their\nterm structure) used to construct the estimates of PD are sourced from Moody’s publications of historical default ratings\nfor sovereign debt and no adjustments are made to these historical PD.\nIt is assumed that Angola and Nigeria will have through-the-cycle (TTC) performance and therefore the Group made no\nmacroeconomic adjustment to the ECL allowance for government bonds and bills. A flat LGD assumption of 40% was\napplied across all bonds and time periods. This is in line with historical statistics that are available from Moody’s\npublications for comparable instruments. The PD curves are built on the credit ratings published by Moody’s for Angola\nand Nigeria.\n(b) Loans receivable (note 13)\nThe Group provides financing to trading partners, such as franchisees, suppliers and certain landlords. Collateral held by\nthe Group as security for these loans receivable is disclosed below.\nKin Oasis Investments Ltd’s holding company, Kinois Investments Ltd, provided a guarantee and indemnity for 100% of\nall present and future payment obligations and liabilities which is in turn secured by a pledge of 60% of the shareholding\nin Kin Oasis Investments Ltd to the Group (refer to note 13.2).\nSuppliers of the Group can obtain funding in the form of secured or unsecured loans.

The rating is then adjusted to\nrepresent the appropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nThe Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit\nlosses. Macroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total\nunemployment rate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rate.\n106\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2)\nInstalment sale receivables comprise a wide-spread client base and external credit checks are made to ensure that all\ninstalment sale clients have an appropriate credit history.\nThe Group’s instalment sale receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in\nthe ordinary course of business. These receivables contain a significant financing component with terms of business\nvarying from six to 36 months. The Group has developed advanced credit-granting systems to properly assess the\ncreditworthiness of its customers.\nCredit granting:\nThe credit underwriting process flows through the following stages:\n(i) Credit scoring: This involves the gathering of appropriate information from the client, use of credit bureaus and third\nparties such as employers. These input variables are run through the various credit scorecards. In assessing\napplications for credit, strict affordability criteria are applied together with in-house developed scorecards based on\ncredit bureau data. Industry-wide fraud detection tools are used to identify potentially fraudulent applications. The\nGroup deals with its new customers and existing customers differently when credit scoring takes place.\nCustomer acquisition takes into account the risk level, repurchase propensity and profitability of new customers.\nBehaviour scorecards are used to determine credit extension to customers in good standing, to drive repurchase\nrates and repeat loans, and reduce average bad debt. These scorecards are regularly reviewed and upgraded to\nensure the Group’s credit policy remains in line with an acceptable level of risk for repeat business.\n(ii) Assessing client affordability: This process involves collecting information regarding the customer’s income levels,\nexpenses and current debt obligations. The Group has its own priority expense model based on surveys conducted\nwith customers in addition to the National Credit Regulator’s expense table. The following factors are then taken into\nconsideration to conclude on the affordability of each customer:\n• Assessing existing financial means and prospects;\n• Assessing existing financial obligations;\n• Assessing debt repayment history; and\n• Ignoring credit agreements that will be substituted.\nThe total cost of credit is disclosed to the consumer.\n(iii) Determining the credit limit for the customer: The customer’s risk score determined by the scorecard together with\nthe expense assessment and outstanding obligations are used to calculate a credit limit within the customer’s\naffordability level.\nThe credit granting systems enable the Group to determine its appetite for risk. In determining the acceptable level of\nrisk, the potential loss is weighed up against the revenue potential using the predictive behavioural models inherent in\nthe credit-granting system. The Group monitors any variances from the level of risk that has been adopted and adjusts\nthe credit-granting process on a regular basis.\nThe Group manages its risk effectively by assessing the customer’s ability to service the proposed monthly instalment.\n107\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nContractual arrears:\nContractual arrears are calculated by reference to the actual arrears in terms of the original signed agreement. The key\naspect of the arrear calculation is the Group’s policy not to reschedule arrears nor to amend the terms of the original\ncontract.\nFrom the onset of the agreement, contractual arrears are calculated by comparing payments made life to date with the\noriginally calculated instalments due life to date, causing a customer who is paying less than the required contracted\ninstalment to immediately fall into arrears. Once the customer exceeds the term of the agreement by paying less than the\nrequired contracted instalments, the full balance owing will be in arrears. The Group does not consider arrears the\nleading indicator, but rather payment ratings for the reasons mentioned above.\nThe tables below reflect the maximum exposure to credit risk on instalment sale receivables as well as the ECL allowance\nand contractual arrears per customer grouping at the reporting date. Customer groupings are determined as follows:\n• Satisfactory paid: Customers who have paid 70% or more of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Slow payers: Customers who have paid 55% to 69% of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Non-performing accounts: Customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period.\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 29 June 2025\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 176 681 1 114 213 19.1% 73 32 19 22\n67.1% 57.6% 32.6%\nSlow payers 29 367 254 110 43.3% 66 14 13 39\n11.2% 13.1% 16.8%\nNon-performing\naccounts 57 104 565 331 58.6% 198 12 13 173\n21.7% 29.2% 50.6%\nTotal instalment\nsale receivables 263 152 1 933 654 33.8% 337 58 45 234\nClassified as\nInstalment sale\nreceivables 18 880 120 84 70.0% 58 10 9 39\nAssets classified\nas held for sale\n(note 4) 244 272 1 813 570 31.4% 279 48 36 195\n263 152 1 933 654 33.8% 337 58 45 234\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 29 June 2025 included in the table above\nNo payment in\nIn duplum Debt counselling 3 consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\nCredit-impaired accounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\ncategories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying\namount 565 4 20 43 24 25 52 733\nECL allowance (331) (1) (9) (9) (12) (12) (13) (387)\nAmortised cost 234 3 11 34 12 13 39 346\n108\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 30 June 2024\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 170 311 1 067 214 20.1% 80 37 22 21\n60.1% 49.5% 24.6%\nSlow payers 31 982 276 113 40.9% 79 17 17 45\n11.3% 12.8% 13.0%\nNon-performing\naccounts 81 259 813 542 66.7% 370 18 19 333\n28.7% 37.7% 62.4%\nTotal instalment\nsale receivables 283 552 2 156 869 40.3% 529 72 58 399\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 30 June 2024 included in the table above\nNo payment in\nIn duplum Debt counselling 3 consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\nCredit-impaired accounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\ncategories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying\namount 813 11 130 44 28 23 48 1 097\nECL allowance (542) (3) (59) (9) (14) (7) (8) (642)\nAmortised cost 271 8 71 35 14 16 40 455\nReconciliation of loss allowance for instalment sale receivables:\n2025 2024\nTotal Total\nAccounts Credit- instalment Accounts Credit- instalment\nnot credit- impaired sale not credit- impaired sale\nimpaired accounts receivables impaired accounts receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nBalance at the beginning of the year 227 642 869 226 581 807\nNew financial assets originated or purchased\nduring the year 141 43 184 150 62 212\nIndividual financial assets transferred to\nnon-performing (credit-impaired financial assets) (71) 71 — (134) 134 —\nAmounts recovered during the year — (3) (3) — (4) (4)\nChanges in risk parameters (29) (161) (190) (12) 6 (6)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible — (203) (203) — (129) (129)\nForeign currency translation differences (1) (2) (3) (3) (8) (11)\nBalance at the end of the year 267 387 654 227 642 869\nClassified as\nInstalment sale receivables 36 48 84 227 642 869\nAssets classified as held for sale (note 4) 231 339 570 — — —\n267 387 654 227 642 869\n109\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nSpecific assumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of instalment sale receivables in terms of the\nsimplified approach for impairment are detailed below.\nProbability-weighted cash flows:\nThe expected credit loss is a probability-weighted estimate and represents the difference between the cash flows that\nare due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at\nthe original effective interest rate including initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the debtor book population’s payment behaviour in\ncombination with a transition matrix. The transition matrix and payment performance for each payment state has been\ndeveloped utilising customer payment history. The transition matrix predicts the population’s payment behaviour and\nprobability of the account being in a particular payment state and transitioning into future payment states. The key states\nin the transitional matrix are the customer’s lifetime payment rating, age of the account and contractual term. The lifetime\npayment rating measures the customer’s actual payments received over the lifetime of the account relative to the\ncontractual instalments due.\nFor modelling purposes, cash flows are forecast on an individual customer level and aggregated over all the customer’s\nsub-accounts until the account is settled or written off. For each contractual term, lifetime payment rating and age, the\ntransitional matrix maps the probability of an account transitioning into future lifetime payment ratings for the remaining\nmonths on book.\nThe payment performance for each payment state is calculated using the actual payment history for each payment rating\nover the last five years to ensure the recency of the impairment model as required by IFRS 9.\nEconomic overlay:\nAn economic overlay has been developed by performing a regression analysis between key economic variables with\nreference to the payment yields over a ten-year period. The model considers a number of macroeconomic variables\nincluding gross domestic product (GDP). The consumer price index and prime overdraft rate were also considered as\nvariables during the previous financial year.\nThe Group makes use of a cash flow model adjusted for coverage percentages unique to each country and each state.\nThe process of determining adjusted coverage percentages involved applying an adjustment to the PDs. The scalar was\nbased on country-specific GDP forecasts.\nThe GDP forecasts used for South Africa are listed below. The IMF GDP forecasts were used for the other African countries.\nCalendar year\nGDP forecast 2025 2026 2027\nBase 1.0% 1.3% 1.8%\n110\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nUpside and downside scenarios using the economic base variables above are determined and a weighted average\nscenario is prepared. This is compared to the base position and an appropriate adjustment is made to the whole trade\nreceivables book.\nThe three scenarios project the future impact of the economic variables on the impairment provision. Management has\nassigned a probability of 40.0% (2024: 30.0%) to the upside scenario, 50.0% (2024: 50.0%) to the base scenario and\n10.0% (2024: 20.0%) to the downside scenario for the 12-month forecast for South Africa.\nSouth Africa\n2025 2024\nImpact of forward-looking information on ECL: Rm % change Rm % change\nProbability-weighted impact of all three scenarios 445 616\n100% upside scenario 443 (0.2) 610 (0.9)\n100% base scenario 444 (0.1) 614 (0.3)\n100% downside scenario 445 0.2 623 1.2\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1)\nSales to retail customers are settled in cash or using debit and credit cards. Except for the total exposure represented by\nthe respective statement of financial position items, the Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.\nThe Group has policies in place to ensure that all sales of goods and services on credit are made to customers with an\nappropriate credit history. Balances are due within 30 days of statement date and the age analysis of these amounts are\nreviewed on a monthly basis. Franchisees comprise a wide-spread client base and the credit history of all franchisees\nare verified with an external credit bureau. Notarial and mortgage bonds and bank guarantees to the value of R3 billion\n(2024: R1.2 billion) are held as collateral for these amounts. Long standing trading relationships exist with the buying aid\nsocieties and the Group reviews the credit history of these societies, based on its own records as well as information\nfrom an external credit bureau, on a cyclical basis. Based on this, the Group considers the credit quality of all fully\nperforming amounts as satisfactory.\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised\ncost, using the lifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix. The behavioural matrix\nlooks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the contracts.\nThe behavioural matrix is based on historically observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a\nportfolio and credit band. This is supported by historical analysis. The following table details the risk profile of trade\nreceivables at the reporting date, based on the Group’s provision matrix.\nTrade receivables – days past due\n31 – 60 days 61 – 90 days 91- 120 days More than 120\nCurrent past due past due past due days past due Total\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nAs at 29 June 2025\nGross carrying amount 2 771 556 82 66 141 3 616\nLifetime ECL (22) (20) (5) (12) (51) (110)\nNet carrying amount 2 749 536 77 54 90 3 506\nExpected credit loss rate 0.8% 3.6% 6.1% 18.2% 36.2% 3.0%\nAs at 30 June 2024\nGross carrying amount 2 562 438 111 44 197 3 352\nLifetime ECL (19) (20) (7) (3) (83) (132)\nNet carrying amount 2 543 418 104 41 114 3 220\nExpected credit loss rate 0.7% 4.6% 6.3% 6.8% 42.1% 3.9%\n111\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for trade receivables:\nAccounts not credit-impaired Credit-impaired accounts\nReceivables\nTotal from Total\nBuying aid trade medical aid Buying aid credit-\nReceivables societies receivables Receivables schemes, societies impaired\nfrom and other not credit- from pharmacies and other trade Total trade\nRm franchisees receivables impaired franchisees and doctors receivables receivables receivables\n2025\nBalance at the beginning\nof the year 15 53 68 6 27 31 64 132\nNew financial assets\noriginated or purchased\nduring the year 16 10 26 — 13 8 21 47\nIndividual financial\nassets transferred to\nnon-performing\n(credit-impaired\nfinancial assets) (15) — (15) 15 — — 15 —\nAmounts recovered during\nthe year — (13) (13) — — (1) (1) (14)\nChanges in risk\nparameters — — — 7 — 6 13 13\nAmounts written off during\nthe year as uncollectible — (38) (38) — (3) (14) (17) (55)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — — (3) (3) (3)\nTransfer to assets\nclassified as held for sale — — — — — (9) (9) (9)\nForeign currency\ntranslation differences — — — — — (1) (1) (1)\nBalance at the end of\nthe year 16 12 28 28 37 17 82 110\n2024\nBalance at the beginning\nof the year — 54 54 7 47 22 76 130\nNew financial assets\noriginated or purchased\nduring the year — 15 15 — 9 4 13 28\nIndividual financial assets\ntransferred to\nnon-performing\n(credit-impaired\nfinancial assets) 3 — 3 (3) — — (3) —\nAmounts recovered\nduring the year — (11) (11) — — (1) (1) (12)\nChanges in risk\nparameters 12 — 12 2 — 1 3 15\nAmounts written off\nduring the year as\nuncollectible — (5) (5) — (29) (8) (37) (42)\nUnused amounts\nreversed — — — — — (1) (1) (1)\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n(note 38.5) — — — — — 20 20 20\nForeign currency\ntranslation differences — — — — — (6) (6) (6)\nBalance at the end of\nthe year 15 53 68 6 27 31 64 132\n112\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) continued\nAssumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of trade receivables in terms of the simplified approach\nfor measuring impairment are detailed below.\nTo measure ECL, trade receivables have been grouped by shared credit risk characteristics by considering the different\nrevenue streams within each operating segment such as franchise, retail and wholesale of pharmaceutical products,\nfurniture, travel packages and ticket sales through Computicket as well as by geographical location and days past due.\nECL are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables at each reporting date. The loss ratio\nis calculated according to the ageing/payment profile of sales by applying historic/proxy write-offs to the payment profile\nof the sales population. In instances where there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy\nwrite-off. Trade receivable balances have been grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of\nreceivables with similar risk characteristics and ability to pay. Similarly, the sales population selected to determine the\nageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population and in line with future payment\nexpectations.\nFor receivables from franchisees, the expected loss ratios are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last 36\nmonths before each reporting period. The expected loss ratios of other trade receivables are based on the payment\nprofiles of sales during the last 12 months before each reporting period.\nThe historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward-looking information to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade\nreceivables at the reporting date to the extent that there is a strong correlation between the forward-looking information\nand the ECL. The Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating\nwith credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment\nrate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected\nmacroeconomic variables are appropriate drivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of the book and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact of\nextrapolating the forward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be\nmonitored and will be reassessed at each reporting date.\n113\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nOther receivables (note 15.3)\nOther receivables consist of various operational debtors such as municipal deposits refundable, insurance claims\nreceivable and staff debtors and bursaries.

Other\nreceivables include significant amounts of insurance claims receivable and staff debtors and bursaries. The remaining\nbalance comprises of various other receivables which are individually insignificant.\nThe PD represents the likelihood of the counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months\n(12-month PD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation. The rating is then adjusted to represent the\nappropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment\nrate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected\nmacroeconomic variables are appropriate drivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of other receivables and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact\nof extrapolating the forward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be\nmonitored and will be reassessed at each reporting date.\n(d) Restricted cash\nIn the prior year the Group classified ring-fenced guarantees reserved in Angola on behalf of the Angola General Tax\nAdministration for objections to tax assessments as restricted cash. During the current financial year, most of the tax\nassessments were finalised and the related ring-fenced guaranteed amounts were released. Restricted cash for the year\nreported consists of a bank deposit which is subject to regulatory restrictions by the South African Reserve Bank in\nrelation to a foreign exchange trading license granted. These restricted cash balances held by the Group are not\navailable for general use by the holding company or other subsidiaries in the Group.\nThe Group applies the general model to measure the loss allowance for restricted cash. All the restricted cash was\ndetermined to be in stage 1 as the counterparties have low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual\ncash flows. There was no SICR of the Group’s restricted cash. ECL were therefore limited to 12-month expected losses.\n115\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(d) Restricted cash continued\n2025 2024\nRm Rm\nAnalysis of total restricted cash:\nRing-fenced Angola tax guarantees — 3\nDeposits held by the South African Reserve Bank 5 —\nGross restricted cash 5 3\nProvision for impairment — —\nCarrying amount included in statement of financial position 5 3\nReconciliation of restricted cash included in statement of cash flows:\nCarrying amount included in statement of financial position 5 3\nLess ring-fenced Angola tax guarantees not available for use by the Group — (3)\nRestricted cash included in statement of cash flows 5 —\n(e) Cash and cash equivalents\nThe Group uses subsidiaries of rated South African and/or international financial institutions as its bankers. However, due\nto the Group’s international operational requirements it is forced to transact with financial institutions in certain countries\nwhere independent internationally accredited credit ratings are not available. In these instances the Group’s exposure to\ncredit risk at each of these financial institutions is evaluated by management on a case by case basis. Cash balances\ndeposited with these financial institutions are kept to an operational minimum and are transferred, subject to exchange\ncontrol regulations and available suitable foreign currency, to financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. The\nGroup has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.\nECL of cash and cash equivalents are calculated in terms of the general model for impairment. All cash and cash\nequivalents were determined to be in stage 1 as the counterparties have low risk of default and a strong capacity to\nmeet contractual cash flows. There was no SICR of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents. ECL were therefore limited\nto 12-month expected losses and the identified impairment loss was considered immaterial.\nThe table below shows the cash invested at the reporting date at financial institutions grouped per Moody’s short-term\ncredit rating of the financial institutions.\nNational Global 2025 2024\nscale scale Rm Rm\nStandard Chartered Bank P-1 741 758\nCitibank P-1 11 208\nBarclays Bank P-1 128 117\nStandard Bank P-1.za P-3 2 090 3 129\nABSA P-1.za P-3 2 627 3 224\nNedbank P-1.za P-3 1 801 1 970\nFirstRand P-1.za P-3 1 337 924\nOther banks 298 285\nCash on hand and in transit 913 1 117\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 9 946 11 732\nLocal currency cash and short-term deposits of R714 million (2024: R489 million) are held in Angola, Nigeria and Malawi\n(2024: Angola, Nigeria and Malawi) and are subject to onerous local exchange control regulations.

The treasury\ndepartment hedges the Group’s net position in each foreign currency by using call deposits in foreign currencies and\nderivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange rate contracts for all cumulative foreign\ncommitments of three months or more. Forward foreign exchange rate contracts are not used for speculative purposes.\nThese instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for purposes of accounting. No forward foreign exchange\nrate contracts were entered into during the current year.\nCurrency exposure arising from the net monetary assets in individual countries, held in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the Group, are managed primarily through converting cash and cash equivalents not required for\noperational cash flows to US dollar, subject to exchange control regulations. The US dollar is the preferred currency due\nto its history of stability, liquidity and availability in most markets.\nShort-term loans between subsidiaries of the Group expose the Group to currency risk resulting from fluctuations in local\ncurrency exchange rates to the US dollar (2025: R313 million liability; 2024: R559 million liability) and South Africa rand\n(2025: R170 million asset; 2024: R852 million liability). This US dollar currency risk is mitigated by the investment in AOA,\nUSD Index Linked, Angola Government Bonds (2025: R539 million asset; 2024: R515 million asset) (refer to note 12.1)\nwhich serves as a natural hedge against the Group’s currency risk on short-term US dollar loans between Group\nsubsidiaries.\nMaterial concentrations of currency risk also exist within the Group’s lease liabilities and net cash and cash equivalents\n(including restricted cash) as follows:\nLease liabilities Net cash and cash equivalents\n2025 2024 2025 2024\nForeign currency Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSouth Africa rand — — 1 27\nUnited States dollar 1 020 1 417 90 264\nNigeria naira — — — 5\nEuro — — — 2\nOther currencies — 1 — 1\n1 020 1 418 91 299\nThe Group does not have significant foreign creditors as most inventory imports are prepaid.\nHedge of net investment in foreign operation\nThe Group hedges a designated portion of its US dollar net assets in Shoprite International Ltd for foreign currency\nexposure arising between the US dollar and South Africa rand as part of the Group’s risk management objectives.\nShoprite International Ltd has a US dollar functional currency. Shoprite Holdings Ltd’s net investment in Shoprite\nInternational Ltd is therefore exposed to fluctuations in the US$/ZAR spot exchange rate. Shoprite International Ltd uses\nthese dollars in order to fund the operations in the various countries outside of South Africa, which also have liabilities\ndenominated in US dollar. As a result of this exposure, the Group designates external lease liabilities denominated in\nUS dollar as hedging instruments. Foreign exchange movements on translation of these hedging instruments are\nrecognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FCTR within shareholders’ equity for the duration of\nthe hedging relationship, offsetting the exchange rate differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on\ntranslation of the designated US dollar net assets of Shoprite International Ltd to South Africa rand. The cumulative\nforeign exchange movement recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon\nloss of control, joint control or significant influence due to the disposal or abandonment of Shoprite International Ltd.\nThe hedging relationship is reset on a monthly basis, whereby the designated portion of the net investment is adjusted to\nequal the value of the hedging instruments.\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedging relationship and through periodic prospective\neffectiveness assessments, by comparing the changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change\nin the spot rate with changes in the net assets designated in Shoprite International Ltd. Hedge ineffectiveness could\narise due to a decrease in the net investment in a foreign operation to a level below that of the designated lease\nliabilities. No hedge ineffectiveness was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\n117\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.2 Market risk continued\n(a) Currency risk continued\nThe effects of the foreign currency-related hedging instruments on the Group’s financial position and performance are as\nfollows:\n2025 2024\nUS$m US$m\nNominal amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 57 77\nRm Rm\nCarrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 1 020 1 417\nTotal carrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities 1 020 1 417\nChange in carrying amount of designated lease liabilities as a result of foreign currency\nlosses 164 (396)\nChange in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness (164) 396\nHedge ratio 100% 100%\nReconciliation of amounts accumulated in the FCTR relating to hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations:\nBalance at the beginning of the year (808) (528)\nChange in carrying amount of hedging instruments as a result of foreign currency\nlosses recognised in other comprehensive income, net of income tax (note 19.1.2) 144 (280)\nBalance at the end of the year (664) (808)\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of currency risk\nWhere material concentrations of currency risk exist within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to calculate\nwhat the increase/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual currencies strengthened or\nweakened against the South Africa rand and the US dollar. At 29 June 2025, the total possible decrease in Group post-\ntax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was R103 million. This amount considers movement in the\nNigeria naira (R9 million decrease) and South Africa rand (R5 million increase) exchange rates to the US dollar (with an\nexpected weakening of 15.5% and 2.2% respectively). Furthermore, the US dollar exchange rate to the South Africa\nrand (with an expected strengthening of 2.2%) contributes a R0.2 million decrease to this amount. At 30 June 2024, the\ntotal possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was R3 million. This\namount considers movement in the Nigeria naira (R27 million increase) and South Africa rand (R42 million decrease)\nexchange rates to the US dollar (with an expected strengthening of 2.3% and 3.3% respectively). Furthermore, the\nUS dollar exchange rate to the South Africa rand (with an expected weakening of 3.4%) contributes a R24 million\nincrease to this amount.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments, exposed to currency risk at the reporting date\nand do not reflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to\nthe self-funding nature of the Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of\nmerchandise and payments to trade and other payables. The possible currency movements were determined based on\nmanagement’s best estimates taking into account prevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nThe Group has a number of investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency\ntranslation risk. Although not subject to market risk, the following constituted significant concentrations of net monetary\nassets/(liabilities), including short-term surplus funds, in currencies other than the reporting currency as at the reporting\ndate, subject to translation risk.\n2025 2024\nForeign currency Rm Rm\nAngola kwanza (780) 343\nBotswana pula (507) (570)\nUnited States dollar 1 640 1 352\nZambia kwacha (645) (319)\n118\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.2 Market risk continued\n(b) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from daily call accounts, bank overdrafts and borrowings. The Group does\nnot account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and therefore a change in\ninterest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss. Fixed rate financial instruments include government\nbonds and bills (refer to note 12), loans receivable (refer to note 13) and instalment sale receivables (refer to note 15.2).\nDaily call accounts and bank overdrafts carry interest at rates fixed on a daily basis and expose the Group to cash flow\ninterest rate risk. The Group analyses this interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Daily cash flow forecasts are done\nand combined with interest rates quoted on a daily basis. This information is then taken into consideration when\nreviewing refinancing/reinvesting and/or renewal/cancellation of existing positions and alternative financing/investing.\nBased on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. The\nscenarios are run only for cash/borrowings that represent the major interest-bearing positions. The weighted average\neffective interest rate on call accounts was 8.6% (2024: 9.0%).\nAs part of the process of managing floating rate interest-bearing debt, the interest rate characteristics of borrowings\n(refer to note 21) are positioned according to the expected movements in interest rates. Interest rate profiles are\nanalysed by the changes in borrowing levels and the interest rates applicable to the facilities available to the Group. The\nChief Financial Officer has the mandate to approve the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate swaps as\ncircumstances dictate. No interest rate swaps were entered into during the current year.\nExposure to interest rate risk on other monetary items consists of amounts receivable from franchisees (note 13.1).\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of interest rate risk\nWhere material concentrations of interest rate risk exists within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to\ncalculate what the increase/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual interest rates the\nGroup’s financial instruments are subject to strengthened or weakened. At 29 June 2025, the total possible decrease in\nGroup post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated interest rate movements, was R3 million. The estimated decrease of\n25 basis points in the South African prime rate would have resulted in a possible increase in Group post-tax profit of\nR1 million. At 30 June 2024, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated interest rate\nmovements, was R66 million. The estimated increase of 75 basis points in the South African prime rate would have\nresulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R56 million.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk at the reporting\ndate and do not reflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly\ndue to the self-funding nature of the Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale\nof merchandise and payments to trade and other payables. The possible interest rate movements were determined\nbased on management’s best estimates taking into account prevailing economic and market conditions and future\nexpectations.\nInterest rate reform risk management\nIn May 2024, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) released a publication prepared by the Market Practitioners Group\n(MPG) providing an update on the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) transition plan with expected timelines.\nJIBAR is expected to cease before the end of 2026. The MPG has designated the South African Overnight Index Rate\n(ZARONIA) as the rate that will replace JIBAR. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, partly due to its borrowings\n(note 21) that are linked to JIBAR. All existing borrowing agreements have a maturity period of more than 12 months and\ninclude clauses pertaining to the interest rate reform, which will be subject to renegotiation. The Group will monitor the\npotential impact of the transition to ZARONIA and is of the opinion that the impact of the anticipated changes will not be\nsignificant.\n\n### 43.4.3 Liquidity risk\nThe risk of illiquidity is managed by using cash flow forecasts, maintaining adequate unutilised banking facilities\n(2025: R11.6 billion; 2024: R9.0 billion) and unlimited borrowing powers. All unutilised facilities are controlled by the Group’s\ntreasury department in accordance with a treasury mandate as approved by the Board of Directors.\nUnder the terms of the major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply bi-annually with the following financial\ncovenants, calculated on the basis that IAS 17: Leases is still applied:\n• The leverage ratio (net debt to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)) must not\nexceed 2.75 times; and\n• The finance costs cover ratio (EBITDA divided by finance costs) must be a minimum of 3.5 times.\nThe fair value of the major borrowing facilities required to comply with the financial covenants are disclosed in note 43.2.\n119\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.3 Liquidity risk continued\nThe Group has complied with these covenants throughout the reporting period and do not foresee any constraints in\ncomplying with these covenants.

The insurance risk\nrelates to the risk that there will be insufficient capital available to honour the claims made by the policyholders in the\ninsurance cell captive arrangements.\nThe risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that an insured event occurs as well as the uncertainty of the\namount of the resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and unpredictable.\nKey assumptions and estimates\nThe asset for remaining coverage includes insurance acquisition cash flows incurred before the related group of insurance\ncontracts has been recognised. The Group does not adjust the asset for remaining coverage for the time value of money as\nthe receipt of premiums occur within less than one year from the provision of coverage.\nThe liabilities for incurred claims are estimated as the ultimate cost of outstanding claims by using a range of standard\nactuarial claims projection techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornheutter-Ferguson methods. These techniques rely on\nthe premise that the Group’s historical claims development can forecast future claims progression and, consequently,\nultimate claims expenses. Past data is utilised to extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs\nper claim (inclusive of claims handling expenses), and claim counts based on previous years’ trends and expected loss\nratios. Analysis of historical claims development primarily focuses on accident years, but can also delve into geographical\nregions, significant business segments, and types of claims.\nFuture rates of claims inflation or loss ratios are usually not explicitly assumed; instead, implicit assumptions from historical\ndata guide the projections. Furthermore, qualitative judgement is applied to evaluate the extent to which past trends may\nnot apply in the future, considering factors such as one-off events, shifts in external or market conditions (for example\npublic attitudes towards claiming, economic circumstances, inflation levels, legal decisions and regulations), as well as\ninternal factors such as portfolio composition, policy characteristics, and claims handling methods. This assessment aims to\ndetermine the estimated ultimate claims cost, accounting for all uncertainties by presenting the probability-weighted\nexpected value outcome from a range of potential scenarios.\nThe reliability of the assumptions is further affected by variation in interest rates, delays in settlement and changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents compensation required by the Group for bearing the uncertainty\nsurrounding the amount and timing of the cash flows of insurance contracts.\nThe Group has estimated the risk adjustment using a confidence level approach. For insurance cell captive arrangements\nwith Old Mutual Life Insurance Company (Namibia) Ltd, the probability distribution of the expected present value of the\nfuture cash flows from insurance contracts is estimated at each reporting date and it calculates the risk adjustment as the\nexcess of the value at risk at the 75th percentile over the expected present value of the future cash flows.\nFor insurance cell captive arrangements with Centriq Insurance Company Ltd, the risk adjustment is calculated as a best\nestimate reserve where there is an equal probability of the actual future claims’ payment being higher or lower than the best\nestimate. The risk adjustment is estimated for the technical reserves to fall within the 75th and 95th percentile of the net\nultimate loss distribution.\nWithin the insurance process, concentration risk may arise where a particular event or series of events could impact heavily\non the Group’s resources. The Group has not formally monitored the concentration risk; however, it has mitigated against\nconcentration risk by structuring event limits in every policy to ensure that the probability is minimised. Therefore, the Group\ndoes not consider its concentration risk to be high.\n121\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025",

The hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Measurements in whole or in part are done by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for\nidentical assets and liabilities. Quoted prices are readily available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing\nservice or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s\nlength basis.\nLevel 2: Measurements are done by reference to inputs other than quoted prices that are included in level 1. These inputs\nare observable for the financial instrument, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. from derived prices).\nLevel 3: Measurements are done by reference to inputs that are not based on observable market data.\nThe Group’s investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 10) and Centriq Insurance Company Ltd\nfirst-party cell captive insurance arrangements (note 11.2) are measured at fair value and classified at level 3. The fair value\nis based on the net asset value at the statement of financial position date.

The Group\nuses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange rate contracts and price swap contracts as economic\nhedges, to hedge certain exposures. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied, using non-derivative\nfinancial instruments, to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s\noperating units.

        "text": "43.4.1 Credit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual\nobligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual\ncharacteristics of each counterparty. Potential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of investment in insurance cell\ncaptive arrangements, government bonds and bills, loans receivable, trade and other receivables, restricted cash as well as\ncash and cash equivalents.\nThe following impairment losses, including reversals of impairment losses, in relation to financial assets are presented as\ncredit impairment losses in the statement of comprehensive income:\n2025 2024\nRm Rm\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) (9) 202\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) 34 30\nGovernment bonds and bills (note 12) (14) (5)\nLoans receivable (note 13) 35 155\nOther receivables (note 15.3) 21 (1)\nNet impairment losses on financial assets in relation to financial assets 67 381\nCredit impairment losses/(reversal of impairment losses) classified as:\nContinuing operations 76 179\nDiscontinued operations (9) 202\n67 381\nThe Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs,\nassumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\nhas occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. ECL are the discounted\nproduct of the probability of default (PD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n• The PD represents the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month\nPD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.\n• The EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default over the next 12 months\n(12-month EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime EAD).\n• The Group calculates loss given default (LGD) as discounted EAD.\nThese three components are multiplied together. This effectively calculates the ECL which is then discounted back to the\nreporting date, using the original effective interest rate, and aggregated. ECL is a probability-weighted outcome.\nThe 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the PD, which varies by type of financial asset.\n100\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nSICR in terms of the general model for impairment\nThe Group considers financial assets subject to assessment for ECL in terms of the general model for impairment, to have\nexperienced a SICR since the time of initial recognition, when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or\nbackstop criteria have been met. The SICR assessment happens on a bi-annual basis per financial asset class, at a\nportfolio level. The criteria used to identify SICR are monitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the credit\nrisk team.\nQuantitative criteria\nWhere the counterparty has not met its minimum contractual obligations for at least one month.\nQualitative criteria\nThe Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Especially the following indicators\nare incorporated:\n• Internal and external credit ratings;\n• Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause\na significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;\n• Changes in general economic and/or market conditions;\n• Changes in the amount of financial support available to the counterparty;\n• Expected or potential breaches of covenants; and\n• Expected delay in payment.\nA backstop is applied if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the simplified model\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified model and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime\nECL. This policy has been applied to all instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables. Lifetime ECL are assessed\nby determining cash flows on a probability-weighted basis and discounting these at the effective interest rate including\ninitiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the following:\n• Transition matrix and conditional probabilities; and\n• Payment performance for each payment state.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the provision matrix\nFor short-term trade receivables, e.g. trade receivables without a significant financing component, the determination of\nforward-looking economic scenarios may be less significant given that over the credit risk exposure period a significant\nchange in economic conditions may be unlikely, and historical loss rates might be an appropriate basis for the estimate of\nexpected future losses. The Group has elected to apply the provision matrix for trade receivables without a significant\nfinancing component and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Lifetime ECL are\nassessed by applying the relevant loss rates to the trade receivable balances outstanding (i.e. a trade receivable age\nanalysis). Due to the diversity of the Group’s customer base, the Group used appropriate groupings if the historical credit\nloss experience showed significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.\n101\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nDefinition of default and credit-impaired assets\nThe Group defines a financial instrument as in default when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within\n90 days of when they fall due. This is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired assets.\nWith regard to credit-impaired accounts, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the\namortised cost, i.e. gross carrying amount less impairment provision, resulting in lower interest revenue.\nThe criteria for credit-impaired accounts (i.e. when the account moves to stage 3 as a result of loss events that have\noccurred after initial recognition) are as follows:\nReceivables arising from contracts with customers:\n• In duplum (the National Credit Act section providing that all charges ceases to accrue once the sum of the charges\nequals the amount of capital outstanding at the time);\n• Debt counselling accounts (as governed by the National Credit Act);\n• Non-performing accounts; and\n• As a backstop, accounts not included in the above categories, where no payment has been received over the last three\nconsecutive months.\nGovernment bonds and bills and loans receivable:\n• Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;\n• Where a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations; and\n• The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.\nOther receivables:\nWhere a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations for three consecutive months.\nCuring\nA credit-impaired account will cure when the customer does not meet the criteria for being a credit-impaired account. For a\ncustomer to cure, a significant improvement in the customer’s payment behaviour is required. Curing occurs in the following\ninstances:\nGovernment bonds and bills:\nWhen the outlook on the Angolan and Nigeria economy, according to major rating agencies, improves from negative to\nbeing stable or positive. This typically happens when the external credit rating improves from initial recognition or the\nprevious reporting period from a rating below BBB- to a rating between AAA and BBB-.\nLoans receivable:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a contractual\nrepayment. If a loan receivable was determined to be credit-impaired, based on the significant difficulty of the counterparty,\nit will cure once there is clear evidence of financial stability from the counterparty.\nInstalment sale receivables:\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a monthly\ninstalment.\n• Accounts in debt counselling will cure when the customer is no longer in debt counselling in terms of the requirements of\nthe National Credit Act.\n• Non-performing accounts will only cure when their lifetime payment rating improves to the extent that the customer has\npaid 55% or more of the amounts due over the contract period. Generally, this will require a significant improvement in\nthe customer’s payment behaviour.\nTrade receivables:\n• In duplum accounts will cure when they no longer meet the requirements of the National Credit Act for being defined as\nan in duplum account.\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nOther receivables:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\n102\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\nWrite-off policy\nThe Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has\nconcluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. This is usually the case when the Group’s in-house collection\ndepartment and external collection companies which supplement the Group’s collection activities are unable to recover\noutstanding balances. Where instalment sale receivables have been written off, the Group may continue to attempt to\nrecover the outstanding amount due.\n(a) Government bonds and bills (note 12)\nThe Group invests in Angola government bonds and treasury bills as well as Nigeria treasury bills. The investment in\nAngola government bonds and treasury bills form part of its hedging strategy against a future foreign exchange\ndevaluation in Angola. The majority of the Angola government bonds are linked to the US dollar, which provides a natural\nhedge against US dollar short-term intergroup loans payable by the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, while the remaining\ngovernment bonds and bills provide high returns.\nNone of the government bonds and bills are past due. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.\nThe table below reflects the maximum exposure to credit risk on government bonds and bills at the reporting date.\n2025 2024\nBasis for\nInternal recognition Gross ECL Carrying Gross ECL Carrying\ncredit rating of ECL Financial instrument ECL amount allowance amount ECL amount allowance amount\ncategory allowance class rate Rm Rm Rm rate Rm Rm Rm\nUnder- Lifetime AOA, USD Index\nperforming ECL Linked, Angola\n(stage 2) Government\nBonds 2.2% 551 (12) 539 2.3% 527 (12) 515\nAOA, Angola\nGovernment\nBonds 2.9% 34 (1) 33 5.0% 303 (15) 288\nAngola Treasury\nBills 0.0% — — — 1.5% 67 (1) 66\nNigeria Treasury\nBills 0.0% — — — 5.6% 18 (1) 17\nTotal government bonds and bills 585 (13) 572 915 (29) 886\nInternal credit rating categories are defined as follows with reference to external credit ratings published by Moody’s for\nAngola and Nigeria:\n• Performing (stage 1): Counterparty has a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows\nbased on external credit ratings ranging between AAA and A+.\n• Underperforming (stage 2): Investments for which there is a SICR.

The underlying PD (including their\nterm structure) used to construct the estimates of PD are sourced from Moody’s publications of historical default ratings\nfor sovereign debt and no adjustments are made to these historical PD.\nIt is assumed that Angola and Nigeria will have through-the-cycle (TTC) performance and therefore the Group made no\nmacroeconomic adjustment to the ECL allowance for government bonds and bills. A flat LGD assumption of 40% was\napplied across all bonds and time periods. This is in line with historical statistics that are available from Moody’s\npublications for comparable instruments. The PD curves are built on the credit ratings published by Moody’s for Angola\nand Nigeria.\n(b) Loans receivable (note 13)\nThe Group provides financing to trading partners, such as franchisees, suppliers and certain landlords. Collateral held by\nthe Group as security for these loans receivable is disclosed below.\nKin Oasis Investments Ltd’s holding company, Kinois Investments Ltd, provided a guarantee and indemnity for 100% of\nall present and future payment obligations and liabilities which is in turn secured by a pledge of 60% of the shareholding\nin Kin Oasis Investments Ltd to the Group (refer to note 13.2).\nSuppliers of the Group can obtain funding in the form of secured or unsecured loans.

The rating is then adjusted to\nrepresent the appropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nThe Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit\nlosses. Macroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total\nunemployment rate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rate.\n106\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2)\nInstalment sale receivables comprise a wide-spread client base and external credit checks are made to ensure that all\ninstalment sale clients have an appropriate credit history.\nThe Group’s instalment sale receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in\nthe ordinary course of business. These receivables contain a significant financing component with terms of business\nvarying from six to 36 months. The Group has developed advanced credit-granting systems to properly assess the\ncreditworthiness of its customers.\nCredit granting:\nThe credit underwriting process flows through the following stages:\n(i) Credit scoring: This involves the gathering of appropriate information from the client, use of credit bureaus and third\nparties such as employers. These input variables are run through the various credit scorecards. In assessing\napplications for credit, strict affordability criteria are applied together with in-house developed scorecards based on\ncredit bureau data. Industry-wide fraud detection tools are used to identify potentially fraudulent applications. The\nGroup deals with its new customers and existing customers differently when credit scoring takes place.\nCustomer acquisition takes into account the risk level, repurchase propensity and profitability of new customers.\nBehaviour scorecards are used to determine credit extension to customers in good standing, to drive repurchase\nrates and repeat loans, and reduce average bad debt. These scorecards are regularly reviewed and upgraded to\nensure the Group’s credit policy remains in line with an acceptable level of risk for repeat business.\n(ii) Assessing client affordability: This process involves collecting information regarding the customer’s income levels,\nexpenses and current debt obligations. The Group has its own priority expense model based on surveys conducted\nwith customers in addition to the National Credit Regulator’s expense table. The following factors are then taken into\nconsideration to conclude on the affordability of each customer:\n• Assessing existing financial means and prospects;\n• Assessing existing financial obligations;\n• Assessing debt repayment history; and\n• Ignoring credit agreements that will be substituted.\nThe total cost of credit is disclosed to the consumer.\n(iii) Determining the credit limit for the customer: The customer’s risk score determined by the scorecard together with\nthe expense assessment and outstanding obligations are used to calculate a credit limit within the customer’s\naffordability level.\nThe credit granting systems enable the Group to determine its appetite for risk. In determining the acceptable level of\nrisk, the potential loss is weighed up against the revenue potential using the predictive behavioural models inherent in\nthe credit-granting system. The Group monitors any variances from the level of risk that has been adopted and adjusts\nthe credit-granting process on a regular basis.\nThe Group manages its risk effectively by assessing the customer’s ability to service the proposed monthly instalment.\n107\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nContractual arrears:\nContractual arrears are calculated by reference to the actual arrears in terms of the original signed agreement. The key\naspect of the arrear calculation is the Group’s policy not to reschedule arrears nor to amend the terms of the original\ncontract.\nFrom the onset of the agreement, contractual arrears are calculated by comparing payments made life to date with the\noriginally calculated instalments due life to date, causing a customer who is paying less than the required contracted\ninstalment to immediately fall into arrears. Once the customer exceeds the term of the agreement by paying less than the\nrequired contracted instalments, the full balance owing will be in arrears. The Group does not consider arrears the\nleading indicator, but rather payment ratings for the reasons mentioned above.\nThe tables below reflect the maximum exposure to credit risk on instalment sale receivables as well as the ECL allowance\nand contractual arrears per customer grouping at the reporting date. Customer groupings are determined as follows:\n• Satisfactory paid: Customers who have paid 70% or more of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Slow payers: Customers who have paid 55% to 69% of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Non-performing accounts: Customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period.\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 29 June 2025\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 176 681 1 114 213 19.1% 73 32 19 22\n67.1% 57.6% 32.6%\nSlow payers 29 367 254 110 43.3% 66 14 13 39\n11.2% 13.1% 16.8%\nNon-performing\naccounts 57 104 565 331 58.6% 198 12 13 173\n21.7% 29.2% 50.6%\nTotal instalment\nsale receivables 263 152 1 933 654 33.8% 337 58 45 234\nClassified as\nInstalment sale\nreceivables 18 880 120 84 70.0% 58 10 9 39\nAssets classified\nas held for sale\n(note 4) 244 272 1 813 570 31.4% 279 48 36 195\n263 152 1 933 654 33.8% 337 58 45 234\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 29 June 2025 included in the table above\nNo payment in\nIn duplum Debt counselling 3 consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\nCredit-impaired accounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\ncategories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying\namount 565 4 20 43 24 25 52 733\nECL allowance (331) (1) (9) (9) (12) (12) (13) (387)\nAmortised cost 234 3 11 34 12 13 39 346\n108\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 30 June 2024\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 170 311 1 067 214 20.1% 80 37 22 21\n60.1% 49.5% 24.6%\nSlow payers 31 982 276 113 40.9% 79 17 17 45\n11.3% 12.8% 13.0%\nNon-performing\naccounts 81 259 813 542 66.7% 370 18 19 333\n28.7% 37.7% 62.4%\nTotal instalment\nsale receivables 283 552 2 156 869 40.3% 529 72 58 399\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 30 June 2024 included in the table above\nNo payment in\nIn duplum Debt counselling 3 consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\nCredit-impaired accounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\ncategories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying\namount 813 11 130 44 28 23 48 1 097\nECL allowance (542) (3) (59) (9) (14) (7) (8) (642)\nAmortised cost 271 8 71 35 14 16 40 455\nReconciliation of loss allowance for instalment sale receivables:\n2025 2024\nTotal Total\nAccounts Credit- instalment Accounts Credit- instalment\nnot credit- impaired sale not credit- impaired sale\nimpaired accounts receivables impaired accounts receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nBalance at the beginning of the year 227 642 869 226 581 807\nNew financial assets originated or purchased\nduring the year 141 43 184 150 62 212\nIndividual financial assets transferred to\nnon-performing (credit-impaired financial assets) (71) 71 — (134) 134 —\nAmounts recovered during the year — (3) (3) — (4) (4)\nChanges in risk parameters (29) (161) (190) (12) 6 (6)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible — (203) (203) — (129) (129)\nForeign currency translation differences (1) (2) (3) (3) (8) (11)\nBalance at the end of the year 267 387 654 227 642 869\nClassified as\nInstalment sale receivables 36 48 84 227 642 869\nAssets classified as held for sale (note 4) 231 339 570 — — —\n267 387 654 227 642 869\n109\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.2) continued\nSpecific assumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of instalment sale receivables in terms of the\nsimplified approach for impairment are detailed below.\nProbability-weighted cash flows:\nThe expected credit loss is a probability-weighted estimate and represents the difference between the cash flows that\nare due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at\nthe original effective interest rate including initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the debtor book population’s payment behaviour in\ncombination with a transition matrix. The transition matrix and payment performance for each payment state has been\ndeveloped utilising customer payment history. The transition matrix predicts the population’s payment behaviour and\nprobability of the account being in a particular payment state and transitioning into future payment states. The key states\nin the transitional matrix are the customer’s lifetime payment rating, age of the account and contractual term. The lifetime\npayment rating measures the customer’s actual payments received over the lifetime of the account relative to the\ncontractual instalments due.\nFor modelling purposes, cash flows are forecast on an individual customer level and aggregated over all the customer’s\nsub-accounts until the account is settled or written off. For each contractual term, lifetime payment rating and age, the\ntransitional matrix maps the probability of an account transitioning into future lifetime payment ratings for the remaining\nmonths on book.\nThe payment performance for each payment state is calculated using the actual payment history for each payment rating\nover the last five years to ensure the recency of the impairment model as required by IFRS 9.\nEconomic overlay:\nAn economic overlay has been developed by performing a regression analysis between key economic variables with\nreference to the payment yields over a ten-year period. The model considers a number of macroeconomic variables\nincluding gross domestic product (GDP). The consumer price index and prime overdraft rate were also considered as\nvariables during the previous financial year.\nThe Group makes use of a cash flow model adjusted for coverage percentages unique to each country and each state.\nThe process of determining adjusted coverage percentages involved applying an adjustment to the PDs. The scalar was\nbased on country-specific GDP forecasts.\nThe GDP forecasts used for South Africa are listed below. The IMF GDP forecasts were used for the other African countries.\nCalendar year\nGDP forecast 2025 2026 2027\nBase 1.0% 1.3% 1.8%\n110\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nUpside and downside scenarios using the economic base variables above are determined and a weighted average\nscenario is prepared. This is compared to the base position and an appropriate adjustment is made to the whole trade\nreceivables book.\nThe three scenarios project the future impact of the economic variables on the impairment provision. Management has\nassigned a probability of 40.0% (2024: 30.0%) to the upside scenario, 50.0% (2024: 50.0%) to the base scenario and\n10.0% (2024: 20.0%) to the downside scenario for the 12-month forecast for South Africa.\nSouth Africa\n2025 2024\nImpact of forward-looking information on ECL: Rm % change Rm % change\nProbability-weighted impact of all three scenarios 445 616\n100% upside scenario 443 (0.2) 610 (0.9)\n100% base scenario 444 (0.1) 614 (0.3)\n100% downside scenario 445 0.2 623 1.2\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1)\nSales to retail customers are settled in cash or using debit and credit cards. Except for the total exposure represented by\nthe respective statement of financial position items, the Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.\nThe Group has policies in place to ensure that all sales of goods and services on credit are made to customers with an\nappropriate credit history. Balances are due within 30 days of statement date and the age analysis of these amounts are\nreviewed on a monthly basis. Franchisees comprise a wide-spread client base and the credit history of all franchisees\nare verified with an external credit bureau. Notarial and mortgage bonds and bank guarantees to the value of R3 billion\n(2024: R1.2 billion) are held as collateral for these amounts. Long standing trading relationships exist with the buying aid\nsocieties and the Group reviews the credit history of these societies, based on its own records as well as information\nfrom an external credit bureau, on a cyclical basis. Based on this, the Group considers the credit quality of all fully\nperforming amounts as satisfactory.\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised\ncost, using the lifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix. The behavioural matrix\nlooks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the contracts.\nThe behavioural matrix is based on historically observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a\nportfolio and credit band. This is supported by historical analysis. The following table details the risk profile of trade\nreceivables at the reporting date, based on the Group’s provision matrix.\nTrade receivables – days past due\n31 – 60 days 61 – 90 days 91- 120 days More than 120\nCurrent past due past due past due days past due Total\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nAs at 29 June 2025\nGross carrying amount 2 771 556 82 66 141 3 616\nLifetime ECL (22) (20) (5) (12) (51) (110)\nNet carrying amount 2 749 536 77 54 90 3 506\nExpected credit loss rate 0.8% 3.6% 6.1% 18.2% 36.2% 3.0%\nAs at 30 June 2024\nGross carrying amount 2 562 438 111 44 197 3 352\nLifetime ECL (19) (20) (7) (3) (83) (132)\nNet carrying amount 2 543 418 104 41 114 3 220\nExpected credit loss rate 0.7% 4.6% 6.3% 6.8% 42.1% 3.9%\n111\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for trade receivables:\nAccounts not credit-impaired Credit-impaired accounts\nReceivables\nTotal from Total\nBuying aid trade medical aid Buying aid credit-\nReceivables societies receivables Receivables schemes, societies impaired\nfrom and other not credit- from pharmacies and other trade Total trade\nRm franchisees receivables impaired franchisees and doctors receivables receivables receivables\n2025\nBalance at the beginning\nof the year 15 53 68 6 27 31 64 132\nNew financial assets\noriginated or purchased\nduring the year 16 10 26 — 13 8 21 47\nIndividual financial\nassets transferred to\nnon-performing\n(credit-impaired\nfinancial assets) (15) — (15) 15 — — 15 —\nAmounts recovered during\nthe year — (13) (13) — — (1) (1) (14)\nChanges in risk\nparameters — — — 7 — 6 13 13\nAmounts written off during\nthe year as uncollectible — (38) (38) — (3) (14) (17) (55)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — — (3) (3) (3)\nTransfer to assets\nclassified as held for sale — — — — — (9) (9) (9)\nForeign currency\ntranslation differences — — — — — (1) (1) (1)\nBalance at the end of\nthe year 16 12 28 28 37 17 82 110\n2024\nBalance at the beginning\nof the year — 54 54 7 47 22 76 130\nNew financial assets\noriginated or purchased\nduring the year — 15 15 — 9 4 13 28\nIndividual financial assets\ntransferred to\nnon-performing\n(credit-impaired\nfinancial assets) 3 — 3 (3) — — (3) —\nAmounts recovered\nduring the year — (11) (11) — — (1) (1) (12)\nChanges in risk\nparameters 12 — 12 2 — 1 3 15\nAmounts written off\nduring the year as\nuncollectible — (5) (5) — (29) (8) (37) (42)\nUnused amounts\nreversed — — — — — (1) (1) (1)\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n(note 38.5) — — — — — 20 20 20\nForeign currency\ntranslation differences — — — — — (6) (6) (6)\nBalance at the end of\nthe year 15 53 68 6 27 31 64 132\n112\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 15.1) continued\nAssumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of trade receivables in terms of the simplified approach\nfor measuring impairment are detailed below.\nTo measure ECL, trade receivables have been grouped by shared credit risk characteristics by considering the different\nrevenue streams within each operating segment such as franchise, retail and wholesale of pharmaceutical products,\nfurniture, travel packages and ticket sales through Computicket as well as by geographical location and days past due.\nECL are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables at each reporting date. The loss ratio\nis calculated according to the ageing/payment profile of sales by applying historic/proxy write-offs to the payment profile\nof the sales population. In instances where there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy\nwrite-off. Trade receivable balances have been grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of\nreceivables with similar risk characteristics and ability to pay. Similarly, the sales population selected to determine the\nageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population and in line with future payment\nexpectations.\nFor receivables from franchisees, the expected loss ratios are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last 36\nmonths before each reporting period. The expected loss ratios of other trade receivables are based on the payment\nprofiles of sales during the last 12 months before each reporting period.\nThe historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward-looking information to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade\nreceivables at the reporting date to the extent that there is a strong correlation between the forward-looking information\nand the ECL. The Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating\nwith credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment\nrate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected\nmacroeconomic variables are appropriate drivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of the book and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact of\nextrapolating the forward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be\nmonitored and will be reassessed at each reporting date.\n113\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.1 Credit risk continued\n(c) Trade and other receivables continued\nOther receivables (note 15.3)\nOther receivables consist of various operational debtors such as municipal deposits refundable, insurance claims\nreceivable and staff debtors and bursaries.

Other\nreceivables include significant amounts of insurance claims receivable and staff debtors and bursaries. The remaining\nbalance comprises of various other receivables which are individually insignificant.\nThe PD represents the likelihood of the counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months\n(12-month PD) or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation. The rating is then adjusted to represent the\nappropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment\nrate (both formal and informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected\nmacroeconomic variables are appropriate drivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of other receivables and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact\nof extrapolating the forward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be\nmonitored and will be reassessed at each reporting date.\n(d) Restricted cash\nIn the prior year the Group classified ring-fenced guarantees reserved in Angola on behalf of the Angola General Tax\nAdministration for objections to tax assessments as restricted cash. During the current financial year, most of the tax\nassessments were finalised and the related ring-fenced guaranteed amounts were released. Restricted cash for the year\nreported consists of a bank deposit which is subject to regulatory restrictions by the South African Reserve Bank in\nrelation to a foreign exchange trading license granted. These restricted cash balances held by the Group are not\navailable for general use by the holding company or other subsidiaries in the Group.\nThe Group applies the general model to measure the loss allowance for restricted cash. All the restricted cash was\ndetermined to be in stage 1 as the counterparties have low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual\ncash flows. There was no SICR of the Group’s restricted cash.

        "text": "43.4.2 Market risk\n(a) Currency risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures. The treasury\ndepartment hedges the Group’s net position in each foreign currency by using call deposits in foreign currencies and\nderivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange rate contracts for all cumulative foreign\ncommitments of three months or more. Forward foreign exchange rate contracts are not used for speculative purposes.\nThese instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for purposes of accounting. No forward foreign exchange\nrate contracts were entered into during the current year.\nCurrency exposure arising from the net monetary assets in individual countries, held in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the Group, are managed primarily through converting cash and cash equivalents not required for\noperational cash flows to US dollar, subject to exchange control regulations. The US dollar is the preferred currency due\nto its history of stability, liquidity and availability in most markets.\nShort-term loans between subsidiaries of the Group expose the Group to currency risk resulting from fluctuations in local\ncurrency exchange rates to the US dollar (2025: R313 million liability; 2024: R559 million liability) and South Africa rand\n(2025: R170 million asset; 2024: R852 million liability). This US dollar currency risk is mitigated by the investment in AOA,\nUSD Index Linked, Angola Government Bonds (2025: R539 million asset; 2024: R515 million asset) (refer to note 12.1)\nwhich serves as a natural hedge against the Group’s currency risk on short-term US dollar loans between Group\nsubsidiaries.\nMaterial concentrations of currency risk also exist within the Group’s lease liabilities and net cash and cash equivalents\n(including restricted cash) as follows:\nLease liabilities Net cash and cash equivalents\n2025 2024 2025 2024\nForeign currency Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSouth Africa rand — — 1 27\nUnited States dollar 1 020 1 417 90 264\nNigeria naira — — — 5\nEuro — — — 2\nOther currencies — 1 — 1\n1 020 1 418 91 299\nThe Group does not have significant foreign creditors as most inventory imports are prepaid.\nHedge of net investment in foreign operation\nThe Group hedges a designated portion of its US dollar net assets in Shoprite International Ltd for foreign currency\nexposure arising between the US dollar and South Africa rand as part of the Group’s risk management objectives.\nShoprite International Ltd has a US dollar functional currency. Shoprite Holdings Ltd’s net investment in Shoprite\nInternational Ltd is therefore exposed to fluctuations in the US$/ZAR spot exchange rate. Shoprite International Ltd uses\nthese dollars in order to fund the operations in the various countries outside of South Africa, which also have liabilities\ndenominated in US dollar. As a result of this exposure, the Group designates external lease liabilities denominated in\nUS dollar as hedging instruments. Foreign exchange movements on translation of these hedging instruments are\nrecognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FCTR within shareholders’ equity for the duration of\nthe hedging relationship, offsetting the exchange rate differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on\ntranslation of the designated US dollar net assets of Shoprite International Ltd to South Africa rand. The cumulative\nforeign exchange movement recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon\nloss of control, joint control or significant influence due to the disposal or abandonment of Shoprite International Ltd.\nThe hedging relationship is reset on a monthly basis, whereby the designated portion of the net investment is adjusted to\nequal the value of the hedging instruments.\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedging relationship and through periodic prospective\neffectiveness assessments, by comparing the changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change\nin the spot rate with changes in the net assets designated in Shoprite International Ltd. Hedge ineffectiveness could\narise due to a decrease in the net investment in a foreign operation to a level below that of the designated lease\nliabilities. No hedge ineffectiveness was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\n117\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.2 Market risk continued\n(a) Currency risk continued\nThe effects of the foreign currency-related hedging instruments on the Group’s financial position and performance are as\nfollows:\n2025 2024\nUS$m US$m\nNominal amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 57 77\nRm Rm\nCarrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 1 020 1 417\nTotal carrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities 1 020 1 417\nChange in carrying amount of designated lease liabilities as a result of foreign currency\nlosses 164 (396)\nChange in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness (164) 396\nHedge ratio 100% 100%\nReconciliation of amounts accumulated in the FCTR relating to hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations:\nBalance at the beginning of the year (808) (528)\nChange in carrying amount of hedging instruments as a result of foreign currency\nlosses recognised in other comprehensive income, net of income tax (note 19.1.2) 144 (280)\nBalance at the end of the year (664) (808)\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of currency risk\nWhere material concentrations of currency risk exist within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to calculate\nwhat the increase/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual currencies strengthened or\nweakened against the South Africa rand and the US dollar. At 29 June 2025, the total possible decrease in Group post-\ntax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was R103 million. This amount considers movement in the\nNigeria naira (R9 million decrease) and South Africa rand (R5 million increase) exchange rates to the US dollar (with an\nexpected weakening of 15.5% and 2.2% respectively). Furthermore, the US dollar exchange rate to the South Africa\nrand (with an expected strengthening of 2.2%) contributes a R0.2 million decrease to this amount. At 30 June 2024, the\ntotal possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was R3 million. This\namount considers movement in the Nigeria naira (R27 million increase) and South Africa rand (R42 million decrease)\nexchange rates to the US dollar (with an expected strengthening of 2.3% and 3.3% respectively). Furthermore, the\nUS dollar exchange rate to the South Africa rand (with an expected weakening of 3.4%) contributes a R24 million\nincrease to this amount.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments, exposed to currency risk at the reporting date\nand do not reflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to\nthe self-funding nature of the Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of\nmerchandise and payments to trade and other payables. The possible currency movements were determined based on\nmanagement’s best estimates taking into account prevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nThe Group has a number of investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency\ntranslation risk. Although not subject to market risk, the following constituted significant concentrations of net monetary\nassets/(liabilities), including short-term surplus funds, in currencies other than the reporting currency as at the reporting\ndate, subject to translation risk.\n2025 2024\nForeign currency Rm Rm\nAngola kwanza (780) 343\nBotswana pula (507) (570)\nUnited States dollar 1 640 1 352\nZambia kwacha (645) (319)\n118\ndeclarations and reports financial statements Annexures\nfinancial statements\n43.4 Financial risk management continued\n43.4.2 Market risk continued\n(b) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from daily call accounts, bank overdrafts and borrowings. The Group does\nnot account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and therefore a change in\ninterest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss. Fixed rate financial instruments include government\nbonds and bills (refer to note 12), loans receivable (refer to note 13) and instalment sale receivables (refer to note 15.2).\nDaily call accounts and bank overdrafts carry interest at rates fixed on a daily basis and expose the Group to cash flow\ninterest rate risk. The Group analyses this interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Daily cash flow forecasts are done\nand combined with interest rates quoted on a daily basis. This information is then taken into consideration when\nreviewing refinancing/reinvesting and/or renewal/cancellation of existing positions and alternative financing/investing.\nBased on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. The\nscenarios are run only for cash/borrowings that represent the major interest-bearing positions. The weighted average\neffective interest rate on call accounts was 8.6% (2024: 9.0%).\nAs part of the process of managing floating rate interest-bearing debt, the interest rate characteristics of borrowings\n(refer to note 21) are positioned according to the expected movements in interest rates. Interest rate profiles are\nanalysed by the changes in borrowing levels and the interest rates applicable to the facilities available to the Group. The\nChief Financial Officer has the mandate to approve the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate swaps as\ncircumstances dictate. No interest rate swaps were entered into during the current year.\nExposure to interest rate risk on other monetary items consists of amounts receivable from franchisees (note 13.1).\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of interest rate risk\nWhere material concentrations of interest rate risk exists within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to\ncalculate what the increase/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual interest rates the\nGroup’s financial instruments are subject to strengthened or weakened. At 29 June 2025, the total possible decrease in\nGroup post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated interest rate movements, was R3 million. The estimated decrease of\n25 basis points in the South African prime rate would have resulted in a possible increase in Group post-tax profit of\nR1 million. At 30 June 2024, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated interest rate\nmovements, was R66 million. The estimated increase of 75 basis points in the South African prime rate would have\nresulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R56 million.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk at the reporting\ndate and do not reflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly\ndue to the self-funding nature of the Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale\nof merchandise and payments to trade and other payables. The possible interest rate movements were determined\nbased on management’s best estimates taking into account prevailing economic and market conditions and future\nexpectations.\nInterest rate reform risk management\nIn May 2024, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) released a publication prepared by the Market Practitioners Group\n(MPG) providing an update on the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) transition plan with expected timelines.\nJIBAR is expected to cease before the end of 2026. The MPG has designated the South African Overnight Index Rate\n(ZARONIA) as the rate that will replace JIBAR. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, partly due to its borrowings\n(note 21) that are linked to JIBAR. All existing borrowing agreements have a maturity period of more than 12 months and\ninclude clauses pertaining to the interest rate reform, which will be subject to renegotiation. The Group will monitor the\npotential impact of the transition to ZARONIA and is of the opinion that the impact of the anticipated changes will not be\nsignificant.",

        "text": "43.5 Insurance risk\nThe Group provides insurance products through its investment in insurance cell captive arrangements with the following\nterms and conditions:\n• Credit protection which covers the risk of the customer being unable to settle the terms of the Credit agreement as a\nresult of death, disability or qualifying retrenchment.\n• All risk cover, which covers the repair or replacement of the product due to accidental loss or damage within the terms\nand conditions of the policy, and extended guarantees which covers the repair or replacement of faulty products as an\nextension of the suppliers’ guarantees.\nThe Group is exposed to insurance risk through its investment in insurance cell captive arrangements. The insurance risk\nrelates to the risk that there will be insufficient capital available to honour the claims made by the policyholders in the\ninsurance cell captive arrangements.\nThe risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that an insured event occurs as well as the uncertainty of the\namount of the resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and unpredictable.\nKey assumptions and estimates\nThe asset for remaining coverage includes insurance acquisition cash flows incurred before the related group of insurance\ncontracts has been recognised. The Group does not adjust the asset for remaining coverage for the time value of money as\nthe receipt of premiums occur within less than one year from the provision of coverage.\nThe liabilities for incurred claims are estimated as the ultimate cost of outstanding claims by using a range of standard\nactuarial claims projection techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornheutter-Ferguson methods. These techniques rely on\nthe premise that the Group’s historical claims development can forecast future claims progression and, consequently,\nultimate claims expenses. Past data is utilised to extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs\nper claim (inclusive of claims handling expenses), and claim counts based on previous years’ trends and expected loss\nratios. Analysis of historical claims development primarily focuses on accident years, but can also delve into geographical\nregions, significant business segments, and types of claims.\nFuture rates of claims inflation or loss ratios are usually not explicitly assumed; instead, implicit assumptions from historical\ndata guide the projections. Furthermore, qualitative judgement is applied to evaluate the extent to which past trends may\nnot apply in the future, considering factors such as one-off events, shifts in external or market conditions (for example\npublic attitudes towards claiming, economic circumstances, inflation levels, legal decisions and regulations), as well as\ninternal factors such as portfolio composition, policy characteristics, and claims handling methods. This assessment aims to\ndetermine the estimated ultimate claims cost, accounting for all uncertainties by presenting the probability-weighted\nexpected value outcome from a range of potential scenarios.\nThe reliability of the assumptions is further affected by variation in interest rates, delays in settlement and changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents compensation required by the Group for bearing the uncertainty\nsurrounding the amount and timing of the cash flows of insurance contracts.\nThe Group has estimated the risk adjustment using a confidence level approach. For insurance cell captive arrangements\nwith Old Mutual Life Insurance Company (Namibia) Ltd, the probability distribution of the expected present value of the\nfuture cash flows from insurance contracts is estimated at each reporting date and it calculates the risk adjustment as the\nexcess of the value at risk at the 75th percentile over the expected present value of the future cash flows.\nFor insurance cell captive arrangements with Centriq Insurance Company Ltd, the risk adjustment is calculated as a best\nestimate reserve where there is an equal probability of the actual future claims’ payment being higher or lower than the best\nestimate. The risk adjustment is estimated for the technical reserves to fall within the 75th and 95th percentile of the net\nultimate loss distribution.\nWithin the insurance process, concentration risk may arise where a particular event or series of events could impact heavily\non the Group’s resources. The Group has not formally monitored the concentration risk; however, it has mitigated against\nconcentration risk by structuring event limits in every policy to ensure that the probability is minimised. Therefore, the Group\ndoes not consider its concentration risk to be high.\n121\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 29 June 2025",
