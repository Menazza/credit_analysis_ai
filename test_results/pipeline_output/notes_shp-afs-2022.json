    "text": "1 Accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and are consistent with those\napplied in the previous year, except where the Company has applied new accounting policies or adopted new accounting standards effective\nfor year-ends starting on or after 1 January 2021.\nThe Company’s separate financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 September 2022. Other than\nthe facts in the annual financial statements, there have been no material changes in the affairs or financial position of the Company from\n3 July 2022 that have an impact on the financial results or disclosures in these annual financial statements.\n\n### 1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe Company reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which treats each financial year as an exact 52-week period, incorporating trade\nfrom Monday to Sunday each week. This treatment effectively results in the loss of a day (or two in a leap year) per calendar year. These days\nare brought to account approximately every six years by including a 53rd week. Accordingly, the results for the financial year under review are\nfor a 52-week period, ended 3 July 2022, compared to 53 weeks in the previous financial year.\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Interpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and comply\nwith the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the\nFinancial Reporting Standards Council (FRSC), the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and the requirements of the South African Companies\nAct, 71 of 2008. The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. The financial statements are prepared on a going\nconcern basis.\n\n### 1.1.1 Use of judgements, assumptions and estimates\n1.1.1.1 Judgements\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of\napplying the Company’s accounting policies.\n1.1.1.2 Assumptions and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions.\nThe most significant assumptions and estimates used in applying the Company’s accounting policies relate to the following:\na) Allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets: The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL\nassociated for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) and the Company recognises an allowance for ECL\nfor these financial assets. The measurement of the ECL allowance is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant\nassumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The ECL allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions\nabout risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the\nimpairment calculations, based on the Company’s history, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of\neach reporting period. Details of the key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in note 15.3.1.\nAll estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that management believes are\nreasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis of judgements about the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying\nassumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is\nrevised and any affected future periods.\n\n### 1.2 INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by the Company. Control is established where\nthe Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns\nthrough its power over the entity. The nature and effect of existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities of the entity are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity.\nThe Company’s investments in the ordinary shares of its subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment losses and, if denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, are translated at historical rates. Purchases and sales of these investments are recognised on the trade date at cost, including\ntransaction costs.\n\n### 1.3 INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES\nAssociates are those entities over which the Company exercises significant influence but not control. Significant influence is presumed to exist\nwhen the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of another entity.\nThe Company’s investments in the ordinary shares of its associates are carried at cost less impairment losses and, if denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, are translated at historical rates. Purchases and sales of these investments are recognised on the trade date at cost, including\ntransaction costs.\nAnnexures 119\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n\n### 1.4 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n### 1.4.1 Initial recognition and measurement\nFinancial instruments recognised on the statement of financial position include trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from\nsubsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables.\nThese financial instruments are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Initial\nrecognition is measured at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs for financial instruments not measured at FVPL.\nTransaction costs of financial instruments carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n### 1.4.2 Derecognition\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or have been transferred\nand the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are\nextinguished, i.e. when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled, expires or when a substantial modification of the terms occurs.\n\n### 1.4.3 Offsetting\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally\nenforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability\nsimultaneously.\n\n### 1.4.4 Classification and subsequent measurement\nFinancial assets\nThe Company classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification and subsequent measurement of debt investments depend on the Company’s business model for managing the financial\nassets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash\nflows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, less\nallowance made for impairment of these assets.\nInterest income from these financial assets is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount, except for:\n• Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. For these financial assets the Company applies the credit-adjusted effective\ninterest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition; and\n• Financial assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets but subsequently have become credit-impaired\nfinancial assets. For these financial assets, the Company applies the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset in\nsubsequent reporting periods.\nAny gain or loss arising on derecognition, modification or impairment is recognised directly in profit or loss.\nThe Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those financial assets changes.\nThe following debt investments are measured at amortised cost in terms of the Company’s business model of holding these financial assets\nto collect solely payments of principal and interest:\na) Trade and other receivables: Trade and other receivables consist of interest accrued.\nb) Amounts receivable from subsidiaries: Amounts receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments\nthat are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Company provides money or services directly to a subsidiary with no\nintention of trading the receivable. The Company holds the amounts receivable with the objective to collect contractual cash flows\nand the contractual terms of the amounts receivable are solely payments of principal and interest. These financial assets are included\nunder current assets unless it matures later than 12 months after the reporting date. Interest on amounts receivable is recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income as part of interest received from subsidiaries.\nc) Cash and cash equivalents: Cash comprises cash at banks. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily\nconvertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Interest on cash and cash equivalents is\nrecognised in the statement of comprehensive income as interest received from bank account balances.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost on the statement of financial position include trade and other payables.\nd) Trade and other payables: Trade and other payables mainly comprise of other payables and accruals and are short-term in nature.\nNon-convertible, non-participating, non-transferable no par value deferred shares, which are mandatorily acquirable on a specific date, are\nclassified as other payables.\nNotes to the separate annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd for the year ended 3 July 2022\n1.4 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED\n1.4.4 Classification and subsequent measurement continued\nFinancial guarantee contracts\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair\nvalue and subsequently at the higher of:\na) The amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9: Financial Instruments; and\nb) The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of\nIFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between the contractual\npayments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that\nwould be payable to a third-party for assuming the obligations.\n\n### 1.4.5 Impairment\nThe Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated for all debt instruments not held at FVPL and the Company\nrecognises an allowance for ECL. ECL are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract\nand all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will\ninclude cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nThe impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).\nThe Company has the following types of financial assets measured at amortised cost that are subject to impairment under the general\nimpairment approach:\n• Other receivables\n• Amounts receivable from subsidiaries\n• Cash and cash equivalents\nGeneral impairment approach\nThe Company applies the general impairment approach to measure ECL for other receivables, amounts receivable from subsidiaries and\ncash and cash equivalents. The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has\nincreased significantly since initial recognition.\nIn the event of a SICR since initial recognition, the Company recognises an allowance (or provision) for ECL resulting from all possible default\nevents over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered\nto be ‘stage 1’; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a SICR are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is\nobjective evidence of impairment are considered to be in default, or otherwise credit-impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.\nThe measurement of ECL under the general impairment approach reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and the\nbest forward-looking information available to the Company. The probability-weighted outcome incorporates the probability of default (PD),\nexposure at default (EAD), timing of when default is likely to occur and loss given default (LGD).\nThe Company recognises in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or reversal, the amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss\nallowance at the end of the reporting period. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for impairment for that\nreceivable. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nNote 15.3.1 provides more detail on how the Company determines a SICR and how the expected credit loss allowance is measured.\n\n### 1.5 STATED CAPITAL\nOrdinary shares, including incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, are both classified as equity.\n\n### 1.6 REVENUE\nRevenue is recognised as follows:\n\n### 1.6.1 Dividend income\nDividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.\n\n### 1.6.2 Effective interest income\nInterest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of financial assets except for financial assets\nthat have subsequently become credit-impaired (or “stage 3”) for which interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to\ntheir net carrying amount (i.e. gross carrying amount less impairment provision). The effective interest rate calculation does not consider ECL\nbut include initiation fees as they are integral to the effective interest rate.\n\n### 1.6.3 Guarantee fees\nGuarantee fees are recognised over the period of the financial guarantee contract at a percentage of the amount guaranteed.\nAnnexures 121\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n\n### 1.7 CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX\nThe income tax expense for the period comprises current income tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, for calculated income tax losses and temporary differences arising between\nthe tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. However, the deferred income tax is not\naccounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of\nthe transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have\nbeen enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised\nor the deferred income tax liability is settled. A change in tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 23 February 2022 for the\nreporting periods ending on or after 31 March 2023. The change has no impact on current tax liabilities arising before its effective date. The\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities will however be affected for the current financial year-end.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which\ntemporary differences can be utilised. Management applies judgement to determine whether sufficient future taxable profit will be available\nafter considering, amongst others, factors such as profit histories, forecasted cash flows and budgets.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except\nwhere the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n### 1.8 DIVIDENDS DISTRIBUTED TO SHAREHOLDERS\nDividends are accounted for on the date they have been declared by the Company.\n\n### 1.9 RELATED PARTIES\nIndividuals, as well as their close family members, or entities are related parties if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control\nor jointly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and/or operating decisions or if the\nparties are jointly controlled in a joint venture. Key management personnel are defined as all Directors of Shoprite Holdings Ltd.\n\n### 1.10 STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AS AT 3 JULY 2022\nThe Company has considered the following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards, which are relevant to the\nCompany’s operations and had been issued by the reporting date, but are not yet effective as at 3 July 2022:\nEffective for the\nNumber Title year ending\nAmendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Disclosure of Accounting Policies 2024\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Reference to the Conceptual Framework) 2023\nThe Company has not early adopted any of the above. The application thereof in future financial periods is not expected to have a significant\nimpact on the Company’s reported results, financial position and cash flows.\n\n### 1.11 NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS EFFECTIVE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 3 JULY 2022\nThe following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are effective for the year ended 3 July 2022:\nNumber Title\nIFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\nNotes to the separate annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd for the year ended 3 July 2022\n2022 2021\nRm Rm",

        "text": "1.7 CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX\nThe income tax expense for the period comprises current income tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, for calculated income tax losses and temporary differences arising between\nthe tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. However, the deferred income tax is not\naccounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of\nthe transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have\nbeen enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised\nor the deferred income tax liability is settled. A change in tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 23 February 2022 for the\nreporting periods ending on or after 31 March 2023. The change has no impact on current tax liabilities arising before its effective date. The\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities will however be affected for the current financial year-end.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which\ntemporary differences can be utilised. Management applies judgement to determine whether sufficient future taxable profit will be available\nafter considering, amongst others, factors such as profit histories, forecasted cash flows and budgets.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except\nwhere the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "15 Risk management and financial instrument disclosure\nThe Board is accountable for the process of risk management, establishing appropriate risk and control policies, and communicating these\nthroughout the Company. The Company follows the Shoprite Holdings Ltd Group’s risk management policies which are designed to identify\nrisks faced by the Group and establish appropriate controls and limits to mitigate the risk to acceptable levels. The Audit and Risk\nCommittee of the Group oversees how management monitors compliance with these risk and control policies.\nThis note discloses information about the Company’s capital risk management and exposure to risks from its use of financial instruments.\n\n### 15.1 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for\nshareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Total capital is\nconsidered to be equity as shown in the statement of financial position.\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to\nshareholders or issue new shares.\n\n### 15.2 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the\ninputs used in determining the measurement. The hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Measurements in whole or in part are done by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and\nliabilities. Quoted prices are readily available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency\nand those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.\nLevel 2: Measurements are done by reference to inputs other than quoted prices that are included in level 1. These inputs are observable\nfor the financial instrument, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. from derived prices).\nLevel 3: Measurements are done by reference to inputs that are not based on observable market data.\nAll financial instruments held by the Company are measured at amortised cost.\nThe book value of all financial assets and liabilities approximate the fair values thereof.\nAnnexures 127\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n\n### 15.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes on debt and interest rates. The\nCompany’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential\nadverse effects on its financial performance.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The treasury\ndepartment identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides\nwritten principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and\ninvesting excess liquidity.\n\n### 15.3.1 Credit risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Company. The\nCompany’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. Potential concentration of\ncredit risk consists primarily of amounts receivable from subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents as well as financial guarantee contracts.\nThe Company’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs, assumptions and\nestimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a SICR has occurred since initial recognition or whether an\nasset is considered to be credit-impaired. ECL are the discounted product of the probability of default (PD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n• The PD represents the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month PD) or over\nthe remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.\n• The EAD is based on the amounts the Company expects to be owed at the time of default over the next 12 months (12-month EAD)\nor over the remaining lifetime (lifetime EAD).\n• The Company calculates loss given default (LGD) as discounted EAD.\nThese three components are multiplied together. This effectively calculates the ECL which is then discounted back to the reporting date,\nusing the original effective interest rate, and aggregated. ECL is a probability-weighted outcome.\nThe 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the PD, which varies by type of financial asset.\nSICR in terms of the general model for impairment\nThe Company considers financial assets subject to assessment for ECL in terms of the general model for impairment to have experienced\na SICR since the time of initial recognition when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or backstop criteria have been met.\nThe SICR assessment happens on a bi-annual basis at a portfolio level. The criteria used to identify SICR are monitored and reviewed\nperiodically for appropriateness by the credit risk team.\nQuantitative criteria\nWhere the counterparty has not met its minimum contractual obligations for at least one month.\nQualitative criteria\nThe Company considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Especially the following indicators are\nincorporated:\n• Internal and external credit ratings;\n• Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant\nchange to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;\n• Changes in general economic and/or market conditions;\n• Changes in the amount of financial support available to the counterparty;\n• Expected or potential breaches of covenants; and\n• Expected delay in payment.\nWrite-off policy\nThe Company writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that\nthere is no reasonable expectation of recovery. This is usually the case when the Company’s in-house collection department and external\ncollection companies which supplement the Company’s collection activities are unable to recover outstanding balances.",

The rights to cash-settled share-based payments entitle the participant to receive cash payments based on the\ndifference between the share price at the date of the exercise of the rights and the strike price which relates to the share price at the date\nof the grant. The Group has recognised the liability in respect of the cash-settled share-based payments and included it in payables\n(refer to note 21).\nRefer to note 25.1 for the expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as employee benefits.\nReconciliation of movement in rights to cash-settled share-based payments granted by the Group:\nNumber of shares on which\nStrike price per share rights are based\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year R6.50 R6.50 1 000 000 1 000 000\nExercised during the year R6.50 R6.50 (1 000 000) —\nBalance at the end of the year — R6.50 — 1 000 000\nRights to cash-settled share-based payments outstanding at the previous year-end were currently exercisable and had an expiry date\nof 5 September 2022. Dr Wiese exercised his rights to cash-settled share-based payments based on 1 000 000 shares on\n6 December 2021 at a market price of R202.04 per share. The total intrinsic value at the exercise date amounted to R196 million.\n\n### 16.2 EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nThe Group offers long-term incentives in the form of rights to ordinary shares of Shoprite Holdings Ltd through participation in the\nShoprite Holdings Ltd Executive Share Plan (ESP) (previously virtual option bonus plan) and the deferred short-term incentive plan\n(previously long-term incentive bonus plan).\nShares granted in terms of the new ESP and deferred short-term incentive plan, as well as the previous virtual option bonus and long-term\nincentive bonus plans, meet the definition of equity-settled share-based payments. The rights to the shares granted entitle the participants\nto receive Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares on vesting at an exercise price of nil. The shares are acquired in the market at the grant\ndate and are held as treasury shares until they are vested. The Company’s main trading subsidiary, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd,\npurchased 1 382 109 (2021: 1 635 742) Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares in relation to shares granted during the year. The\nownership of these shares vests with Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd until vesting conditions are met by the participants. The participants are\nentitled to the dividends and voting rights in relation to the shares granted during the vesting period. The vesting conditions for each plan\nare set out below.\nRefer to note 25.1 for the expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as employee benefits. The reconciliation of\namounts recorded in the share-based payments reserve is presented in note 17.1.1.\nESP\nEmployees that participate in the ESP may be eligible for performance shares, retention shares and/or co-investment shares. These\nshares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee\ndoes not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights\nin respect of the ESP shares.\nESP performance shares: Performance conditions, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are attached to these shares.\nVesting is dependent on the achievement of the performance criteria by the vesting date and the employee meeting the service\nrequirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nESP co-investment shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. As an additional vesting condition,\nthe employee is required to acquire and hold Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares, without any encumbrance, for the entire vesting\nperiod.\nESP retention shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nAnnexures 61\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n16.2 EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED\nDeferred short-term incentive plan\nUnder the Group’s deferred short-term incentive plan, employees may be eligible for shares, based on the achievement of short-term\nincentive criteria for the reporting period. The rights are granted at the end of September of the following financial year. There are no\nperformance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee meeting the service requirement of\nremaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. These shares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting\nconditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain\nlimited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.\nAt the grant date, employees may elect to settle their unvested benefits earned in respect of the previous year in shares. The Group\ntherefore grants shares to management in the form of forfeitable retention share awards, resulting in a modification of a cash bonus\narrangement to a share-based payment arrangement, as a portion of incentive bonuses previously allocated to management in terms of\nthe deferred short-term incentive plan is converted to shares in Shoprite Holdings Ltd. The Group recognises a modification of a cash\nbonus arrangement in respect of these deferred short-term incentives and transfers the liability as at the modification date from provisions\nto the share-based payments reserve within equity. The vesting conditions and vesting periods are not affected by this modification.\nVirtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans\nThe virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans have been replaced by the ESP and deferred short-term incentive plan\nrespectively during the year ended 28 June 2020. The previous virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans operated in the\nsame manner as the new deferred short-term incentive plan, with the exception of different vesting periods as determined under the virtual\noption bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans. These shares vest in equal thirds over a three-, four- and five-year period from the\ngrant date, if vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions,\nother than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.\n\n###

The rights to the shares granted entitle the participants\nto receive Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares on vesting at an exercise price of nil. The shares are acquired in the market at the grant\ndate and are held as treasury shares until they are vested. The Company’s main trading subsidiary, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd,\npurchased 1 382 109 (2021: 1 635 742) Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares in relation to shares granted during the year. The\nownership of these shares vests with Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd until vesting conditions are met by the participants. The participants are\nentitled to the dividends and voting rights in relation to the shares granted during the vesting period. The vesting conditions for each plan\nare set out below.\nRefer to note 25.1 for the expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as employee benefits. The reconciliation of\namounts recorded in the share-based payments reserve is presented in note 17.1.1.\nESP\nEmployees that participate in the ESP may be eligible for performance shares, retention shares and/or co-investment shares. These\nshares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee\ndoes not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights\nin respect of the ESP shares.\nESP performance shares: Performance conditions, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are attached to these shares.\nVesting is dependent on the achievement of the performance criteria by the vesting date and the employee meeting the service\nrequirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nESP co-investment shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. As an additional vesting condition,\nthe employee is required to acquire and hold Shoprite Holdings Ltd ordinary shares, without any encumbrance, for the entire vesting\nperiod.\nESP retention shares: There are no performance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee\nmeeting the service requirement of remaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period.\nAnnexures 61\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n16.2 EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED\nDeferred short-term incentive plan\nUnder the Group’s deferred short-term incentive plan, employees may be eligible for shares, based on the achievement of short-term\nincentive criteria for the reporting period. The rights are granted at the end of September of the following financial year. There are no\nperformance conditions attached to these shares. Vesting is only dependent on the employee meeting the service requirement of\nremaining employed by the Group throughout the vesting period. These shares vest three years from the grant date if the vesting\nconditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions, other than in certain\nlimited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.\nAt the grant date, employees may elect to settle their unvested benefits earned in respect of the previous year in shares. The Group\ntherefore grants shares to management in the form of forfeitable retention share awards, resulting in a modification of a cash bonus\narrangement to a share-based payment arrangement, as a portion of incentive bonuses previously allocated to management in terms of\nthe deferred short-term incentive plan is converted to shares in Shoprite Holdings Ltd. The Group recognises a modification of a cash\nbonus arrangement in respect of these deferred short-term incentives and transfers the liability as at the modification date from provisions\nto the share-based payments reserve within equity. The vesting conditions and vesting periods are not affected by this modification.\nVirtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans\nThe virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans have been replaced by the ESP and deferred short-term incentive plan\nrespectively during the year ended 28 June 2020. The previous virtual option bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans operated in the\nsame manner as the new deferred short-term incentive plan, with the exception of different vesting periods as determined under the virtual\noption bonus and long-term incentive bonus plans. These shares vest in equal thirds over a three-, four- and five-year period from the\ngrant date, if vesting conditions (subject to certain special circumstances) are met. If the employee does not fulfil the vesting conditions,\nother than in certain limited circumstances, the award will lapse and the employee will lose all rights in respect of these shares.",

The gearing ratio is calculated as interest-bearing borrowings and lease\nliabilities divided by equity and was 144.9% (2021: 155.6%) at the reporting date.\nThe Group is currently maintaining a 1.75 times dividend cover based on diluted headline earnings per share from continuing operations.\n\n### 40.2 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the\ninputs used in determining the measurement. The hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Measurements in whole or in part are done by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and\nliabilities. Quoted prices are readily available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency\nand those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.\nLevel 2: Measurements are done by reference to inputs other than quoted prices that are included in level 1. These inputs are observable\nfor the financial instrument, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. from derived prices).\nLevel 3: Measurements are done by reference to inputs that are not based on observable market data.\nThe Group’s investment in Centriq Insurance Company Ltd first-party cell captive insurance arrangements are measured at fair value and\nclassified at level 3 (refer to 9.2). The fair value is based on the net asset value of the insurance cells at the statement of financial\nnote\nposition date. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.\nAll other financial instruments held by the Group are measured at amortised cost. The fair value of these financial instruments is calculated\nusing cash flows discounted at a rate based on the market related borrowings rate as indicated.\nThe following tables reflect the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy, at\nthe reporting date. It does not include inputs used to determine the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair\nvalue of financial instruments classified at level 3. Fair value disclosures are not presented for lease liabilities, as this is not a requirement in\nterms of IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial

For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and\nthe counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when the counterparty fails to timeously comply with its obligations.\n\n### 40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in debt, foreign currency exchange rates and\ninterest rates. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise\npotential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign\nexchange rate contracts and price swap contracts as economic hedges, to hedge certain exposures. Where all relevant criteria are met,\nhedge accounting is applied, using non-derivative financial instruments, to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging\ninstrument and the hedged item.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The treasury\ndepartment identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides\nwritten principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange rate risk, interest\nrate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.\nAnnexures 91\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\n### 40.4.1 Credit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting\nin financial loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.\nPotential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of investment in insurance cell captive arrangements, government bonds and bills,\nloans receivable, trade and other receivables, restricted cash as well as cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following impairment losses, including reversals of impairment losses, in relation to financial assets are presented as credit impairment\nlosses in the statement of comprehensive income:\n2022 2021\nRm Rm\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) 120 62\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) 6 5\nGovernment bonds and bills (note 10) (35) 17\nLoans receivable (note 11) 120 174\nOther receivables (note 13.3) (38) (36)\nNet impairment losses on financial assets 173 222\nOf the previously mentioned impairment losses, R126 million (2021: R67 million) relate to receivables arising from contracts with customers.\nThe Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs, assumptions and\nestimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has occurred\nsince initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. ECL are the discounted product of the probability of default\n(PD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n• The PD represents the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month PD) or over\nthe remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.\n• The EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default over the next 12 months (12-month EAD) or\nover the remaining lifetime (lifetime EAD).\n• The Group calculates loss given default (LGD) as discounted EAD.\nThese three components are multiplied together. This effectively calculates the ECL which is then discounted back to the reporting date,\nusing the original effective interest rate, and aggregated. ECL is a probability-weighted outcome.\nThe 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the PD, which varies by type of financial asset.\nSICR in terms of the general model for impairment\nThe Group considers financial assets subject to assessment for ECL in terms of the general model for impairment, to have experienced a\nSICR since the time of initial recognition, when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or backstop criteria have been met.\nThe SICR assessment happens on a bi-annual basis per financial asset class, at a portfolio level. The criteria used to identify SICR are\nmonitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the credit risk team.\nQuantitative criteria\nWhere the counterparty has not met its minimum contractual obligations for at least one month.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nQualitative criteria\nThe Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Especially the following indicators are incorporated:\n•\nInternal and external credit ratings;\n• Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant\nchange to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;\n• Changes in general economic and/or market conditions;\n• Changes in the amount of financial support available to the counterparty;\n• Expected or potential breaches of covenants; and\n• Expected delay in payment.\nA backstop is applied if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the simplified model\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified model and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. This\npolicy has been applied to all instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables. Lifetime ECL are assessed by determining cash flows\non a probability-weighted basis and discounting these at the effective interest rate including initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the following:\n• Transition matrix and conditional probabilities; and\n•\nPayment performance for each payment state.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the provision matrix\nFor short-term trade receivables, e.g. trade receivables without a significant financing component, the determination of forward-looking\neconomic scenarios may be less significant given that over the credit risk exposure period a significant change in economic conditions may\nbe unlikely, and historical loss rates might be an appropriate basis for the estimate of expected future losses. The Group has elected to\napply the provision matrix for trade receivables without a significant financing component and measures the impairment allowance at an\namount equal to lifetime ECL. Lifetime ECL are assessed by applying the relevant loss rates to the trade receivable balances outstanding\n(i.e. a trade receivable age analysis). Due to the diversity of the Group’s customer base, the Group used appropriate groupings if the\nhistorical credit loss experience showed significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.\nDefinition of default and credit-impaired assets\nThe Group defines a financial instrument as in default when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 90 days of when\nthey fall due. This is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired assets.\nWith regard to credit-impaired accounts, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost, i.e.\ngross carrying amount less impairment provision, resulting in lower interest revenue.\nThe criteria for credit-impaired accounts (i.e. when the account moves to stage 3 as a result of loss events that have occurred after initial\nrecognition) are as follows:\nReceivables arising from contracts with customers:\n• In duplum (the National Credit Act section providing that all charges ceases to accrue once the sum of the charges equals the amount\nof capital outstanding at the time);\n• Debt counselling accounts (as governed by the National Credit Act);\n• Non-performing accounts; and\n• As a backstop, accounts not included in the above categories, where no payment has been received over the last three consecutive\nmonths.\nGovernment bonds and bills and loans receivable:\n• Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;\n• Where a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations; and\n• The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.\nOther receivables:\nWhere a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations for three consecutive months.\nAnnexures 93\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nCuring\nA credit-impaired account will cure when the customer does not meet the criteria for being a credit-impaired account. For a customer to\ncure, a significant improvement in the customer’s payment behaviour is required. Curing occurs in the following instances:\nGovernment bonds and bills:\nWhen the outlook on the Angolan economy, according to major rating agencies, improves from negative to being stable or positive.\nThis typically happens when the external credit rating improves from initial recognition or the previous reporting period from a rating below\nBBB- to a rating between AAA and BBB-.\nLoans receivable:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of payment. If a loan receivable was\ndetermined to be credit-impaired, based on the significant difficulty of the counterparty, it will cure once there is clear evidence of financial\nstability from the counterparty.\nInstalment sale receivables:\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of payment.\n• Accounts in debt counselling will cure when the customer is no longer in debt counselling in terms of the requirements of the National\nCredit Act.\n• Non-performing accounts will only cure when their lifetime payment rating improves to the extent that the customer has paid 55% or\nmore of the amounts due over the contract period. Generally, this will require a significant improvement in the customer’s payment\nbehaviour.\nTrade receivables:\n• In duplum accounts will cure when they no longer meet the requirements of the National Credit Act for being defined as an in duplum\naccount.\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nOther receivables:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nWrite-off policy\nThe Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there\nis no reasonable expectation of recovery. This is usually the case when the Group’s in-house collection department and external collection\ncompanies which supplement the Group’s collection activities are unable to recover outstanding balances.\na) Government bonds and bills (note 10)\nThe Group invests in Angola government bonds and treasury bills as part of its hedging strategy against a future foreign exchange\ndevaluation in Angola. The majority of the government bonds are linked to the US dollar, which provides a natural hedge against\nUS dollar short-term intergroup loans payable by the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, while the remaining government bonds and bills\nprovide high returns.\nNone of the government bonds and bills are past due. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.\nThe table below reflects the maximum exposure to credit risk on government bonds and bills at the reporting date.\n2022 2021\nBasis for\nInternal recognition Gross ECL Carrying Gross ECL Carrying\ncredit rating of ECL ECL amount allowance amount ECL amount allowance amount\ncategory allowance Financial instrument class rate Rm Rm Rm rate Rm Rm Rm\nUnder­ Lifetime AOA, USD Index\nperforming ECL Linked, Angola\n(stage 2) Government Bonds 4.8% 776 (37) 739 3.9% 912 (36) 876\nAOA, Angola\nGovernment Bonds 5.4% 632 (34) 598 4.9% 589 (29) 560\nAngola Treasury Bills 0.0% — — — 6.5% 62 (4) 58\nTotal government bonds and bills 1 408 (71) 1 337 1 563 (69) 1 494\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\na) Government bonds and bills (note 10) continued\nInternal credit rating categories are defined as follows with reference to external credit ratings published by Standard & Poor’s for Angola:\n• Performing (stage 1): Counterparty has a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows based on\nexternal credit ratings ranging between AAA and A+.\n• Underperforming (stage 2): Investments for which there is a SICR. External credit ratings deteriorated from being internally\nclassified as performing to between A and BBB-.\n• Non-performing (stage 3): Interest and/or principal repayments are 90 days past due.\nReconciliation of loss allowance for government bonds and bills:\nUnder-performing (stage 2)\n2022 2021\nRm Rm\nBalance at the beginning of the year 69 71\nNew financial assets originated or purchased during the year 1 76\nUnused amounts reversed (36) (59)\nForeign currency translation differences 37 (19)\nBalance at the end of the year 71 69\nSpecific assumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of government bonds and bills in terms of the general model for\nimpairment are detailed below.\nThe PD represents the likelihood of the Angola Government defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month PD)\nor over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation. The underlying PD (including their term structure) used to construct the\nestimates of PD are sourced from Moody’s publications of historical default ratings for sovereign debt and no adjustments are made to\nthese historical PD.\nIt is assumed that Angola will have a through-the-cycle (TTC) performance and therefore the Group made no macroeconomic\nadjustment to the ECL allowance for government bonds and bills. A flat LGD assumption of 40% was applied across all bonds and\ntime periods. This is in line with historical statistics that are available from Moody’s publications for comparable instruments. The PD\ncurves are built on the credit ratings published by Standard & Poor’s for Angola.\nAnnexures 95\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nb) Loans receivable (note 11)\nThe Group provides financing to trading partners, such as franchisees and certain landlords in countries outside South Africa to enable\nthe Group to secure strategic sites as anchor tenant. Collateral held by the Group as security for these loans receivable is disclosed\nbelow.\nThe Group does not hold any collateral as security for the South Africa rand denominated shareholder loan receivable from\nResilient Africa (Pty) Ltd (refer to note 11.1.1). The Group manages its credit risk by holding share pledges and cession agreements in\nthe underlying subsidiaries of Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd as collateral for the US dollar denominated loan receivable (refer to note 11.1.2).\nCircle Mall Mauritius Ltd’s holding company provided a guarantee and indemnity for 50% of the loan amount which is in turn secured by\na pledge of 100% of the shareholding in Circle Mall Mauritius Ltd to the Group (refer to note 11.3).\nKin Oasis Investments Ltd’s holding company, Kinois Investments Ltd, provided a guarantee and indemnity for 100% of all present and\nfuture payment obligations and liabilities which is in turn secured by a pledge of 60% of the shareholding in Kin Oasis Investments Ltd\nto the Group (refer to note 11.4).\nAmounts receivable from franchisees relate to a wide-spread number of franchisees which are individually insignificant.

Global Corporate Average Cumulative Default Rates With Rating Modifiers\n(1981 – 2021) (%) as published on 13 April 2022 by Standard and Poor’s for corporate exposures are used as input to these\ncalculations. The rating is then adjusted to represent the appropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nThe Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment rate (both formal\nand informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rate.\nc) Trade and other receivables\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2)\nInstalment sale receivables comprise a wide-spread client base and external credit checks are made to ensure that all instalment sale\nclients have an appropriate credit history.\nThe Group’s instalment sale receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary\ncourse of business. These receivables contain a significant financing component with terms of business varying from 12 to 36 months.\nThe Group has developed advanced credit-granting systems to properly assess the creditworthiness of its customers.\nCredit granting:\nThe credit underwriting process flows through the following stages:\n(i) Credit scoring: This involves the gathering of appropriate information from the client, use of credit bureaus and third parties such\nas employers. These input variables are run through the various credit scorecards. In assessing applications for credit, strict\naffordability criteria are applied together with in-house developed scorecards based on credit bureau data. Industry-wide fraud\ndetection tools are used to identify potentially fraudulent applications. The Group deals with its new customers and existing\ncustomers differently when credit scoring takes place.\nCustomer acquisition takes into account the risk level, repurchase propensity and profitability of new customers. Behaviour\nscorecards are used to determine credit extension to customers in good standing, to drive repurchase rates and repeat loans, and\nreduce average bad debt. These scorecards are regularly reviewed and upgraded to ensure the Group’s credit policy remains in line\nwith an acceptable level of risk for repeat business.\nAnnexures 97\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\n(ii) Assessing client affordability: This process involves collecting information regarding the customer’s income levels, expenses and\ncurrent debt obligations. The Group has its own priority expense model based on surveys conducted with customers in addition to\nthe National Credit Regulator’s expense table. The following factors are then taken into consideration to conclude on the affordability\nof each customer:\n• Assessing existing financial means and prospects;\n• Assessing existing financial obligations;\n• Assessing debt repayment history; and\n• Ignoring credit agreements that will be substituted.\nThe total cost of credit is disclosed to the consumer.\n(iii) Determining the credit limit for the customer: The customer’s risk score determined by the scorecard together with the\nexpense assessment and outstanding obligations are used to calculate a credit limit within the customer’s affordability level.\nThe credit granting systems enable the Group to determine its appetite for risk. In determining the acceptable level of risk, the potential\nloss is weighed up against the revenue potential using the predictive behavioural models inherent in the credit-granting system. The\nGroup monitors any variances from the level of risk that has been adopted and adjusts the credit-granting process on a regular basis.\nThe Group manages its risk effectively by assessing the customer’s ability to service the proposed monthly instalment.\nContractual arrears:\nContractual arrears are calculated by reference to the actual arrears in terms of the original signed agreement. The key aspect of the\narrear calculation is the Group’s policy not to reschedule arrears nor to amend the terms of the original contract.\nFrom the onset of the agreement, contractual arrears are calculated by comparing payments made life to date with the originally\ncalculated instalments due life to date, causing a customer who is paying less than the required contracted instalment to immediately\nfall into arrears. Once the customer exceeds the term of the agreement by paying less than the required contracted instalments, the full\nbalance owing will be in arrears. The Group does not consider arrears the leading indicator, but rather payment ratings for the reasons\nmentioned above.\nThe tables below reflect the maximum exposure to credit risk on instalment sale receivables as well as the ECL allowance and\ncontractual arrears per customer grouping at the reporting date. Customer groupings are determined as follows:\n• Satisfactory paid: Customers who have paid 70% or more of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Slow payers: Customers who have paid 55% to 69% of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Non-performing accounts: Customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 3 July 2022\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 94 408 824 193 23.4% 59 26 15 18\n38.4% 43.2% 22.7%\nSlow payers 31 314 274 135 49.3% 71 14 14 43\n12.7% 14.4% 15.8%\nNon-performing accounts 120 258 809 524 64.8% 373 15 17 341\n48.9% 42.4% 61.5%\nTotal instalment sale\nreceivables 245 980 1 907 852 44.7% 503 55 46 402\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 3 July 2022 included in the table above\nNo payment in 3\nIn duplum Debt counselling consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\naccounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\nCredit-impaired categories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying amount 809 10 90 9 13 14 30 975\nECL allowance (524) (3) (40) (2) (7) (4) (7) (587)\nAmortised cost 285 7 50 7 6 10 23 388\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 4 July 2021\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 133 061 750 173 23.1% 179 67 39 73\n55.1% 44.9% 22.6%\nSlow payers 30 993 238 104 43.7% 56 8 7 41\n12.8% 14.3% 13.6%\nNon-performing accounts 77 380 678 488 72.0% 164 6 4 154\n32.1% 40.7% 63.8%\nTotal instalment sale\nreceivables 241 434 1 666 765 45.9% 399 81 50 268\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 4 July 2021 included in the table above\nNo payment in 3\nIn duplum Debt counselling consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\naccounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\nCredit-impaired categories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying amount 678 11 66 11 7 10 23 806\nECL allowance (488) (3) (30) (2) (4) (4) (5) (536)\nAmortised cost 190 8 36 9 3 6 18 270\nAnnexures 99\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for instalment sale receivables:\n2022 2021\nTotal Total\nAccounts Credit- instalment Accounts Credit- instalment\nnot credit- impaired sale not credit- impaired sale\nimpaired accounts receivables impaired accounts receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nBalance at the beginning of the year 229 536 765 231 587 818\nNew financial assets originated or purchased during\nthe year 140 64 204 131 56 187\nIndividual financial assets transferred to non-performing\n(credit-impaired financial assets) (148) 148 — (128) 128 —\nAmounts recovered during the year — (115) (115) — (117) (117)\nChanges in risk parameters 34 (3) 31 6 (14) (8)\nAmounts written off during the year as uncollectible — (63) (63) — (82) (82)\nForeign currency translation differences 10 20 30 (11) (22) (33)\nBalance at the end of the year 265 587 852 229 536 765\nSpecific assumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of instalment sale receivables in terms of the simplified\napproach for impairment are detailed below.\nProbability-weighted cash flows:\nThe expected credit loss is a probability-weighted estimate and represents the difference between the cash flows that are due to the\nGroup in accordance with the contract and the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate\nincluding initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the debtor book population’s payment behaviour in combination with a\ntransition matrix. The transition matrix and payment performance for each payment state has been developed utilising customer\npayment history. The transition matrix predicts the population’s payment behaviour and probability of the account being in a particular\npayment state and transitioning into future payment states. The key states in the transitional matrix are the customer’s lifetime payment\nrating, age of the account and contractual term. The lifetime payment rating measures the customer’s actual payments received over\nthe lifetime of the account relative to the contractual instalments due.\nFor modelling purposes, cash flows are forecast on an individual customer level and aggregated over all the customer’s sub-accounts\nuntil the account is settled or written off. For each contractual term, lifetime payment rating and age, the transitional matrix maps the\nprobability of an account transitioning into future lifetime payment ratings for the remaining months on book.\nThe payment performance for each payment state is calculated using the actual payment history for each payment rating over the last\nfive years to ensure the recency of the impairment model as required by IFRS 9.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nEconomic overlay:\nAn economic overlay has been developed by performing a regression analysis between key economic variables with reference to the\nnon-performing category over a five-year period (customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period).\nThe model considers a number of macroeconomic variables including gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index, prime\noverdraft rate and unemployment rate.\nIn the comparative year the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the South African consumer affected the relative probability of the\nthree scenarios, thus affecting the forward-looking economic overlay applied on the impairment provision. The provision estimates were\nadjusted to account for this expected increase in risk of missed payments or default, due to Covid-19 related financial stress inhibiting\nthe ability and prioritisation of clients to pay their debt to the Group.\nThe Group makes use of a cash flow model adjusted for coverage percentages unique to each country and each state. The process of\ndetermining adjusted coverage percentages involved applying an adjustment to the PDs. In the comparative year these PDs were\nadjusted by a scalar to account for the economic stress caused by Covid-19. The scalar was based on country-specific GDP forecasts.\nThe GDP forecasts used for South Africa are listed below. The IMF GDP forecasts were used for the other African countries.\nCalendar year\n2022 2023 2024\nScenario\nUpside 2.2% 2.0% 1.6%\nBase (4.9%) (0.7%) (0.1%)\nDownside 7.1% 3.9% 3.9%\nUpside, base and downside scenarios using the economic variables above are determined and a weighted average scenario is\nprepared. This is compared to the base position and an appropriate adjustment is made to the whole trade receivables book.\nThe three scenarios project the future impact of the economic variables on the impairment provision. Management has assigned a\nprobability of 6.0% (2021: 0.0%) to the upside scenario, 77.0% (2021: 60.0%) to the base scenario and 17.0% (2021: 40.0%) to\nthe downside scenario for the 12-month forecast for South Africa.\n2022 2021\nSouth Africa South Africa\nImpact of forward-looking information on ECL: Rm % change Rm % change\nProbability-weighted impact of all three scenarios 426 380\n100% upside scenario 407 (4.4) 352 (7.4)\n100% base scenario 413 (3.2) 372 (2.1)\n100% downside scenario 494 15.9 393 3.2\nAnnexures 101\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1)\nSales to retail customers are settled in cash or using debit and credit cards. Except for the total exposure represented by the respective\nstatement of financial position items, the Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.\nThe Group has policies in place to ensure that all sales of goods and services on credit are made to customers with an appropriate\ncredit history. Balances are due within 30 days of statement date and the age analysis of these amounts are reviewed on a monthly\nbasis. Franchisees comprise a wide-spread client base and the credit history of all franchisees are verified with an external credit\nbureau. Notarial and mortgage bonds and bank guarantees to the value of R1.3 billion (2021: R1.1 billion) are held as collateral for\nthese amounts. Long standing trading relationships exist with the buying aid societies and the Group reviews the credit history of these\nsocieties, based on its own records as well as information from an external credit bureau, on a cyclical basis. Based on this, the Group\nconsiders the credit quality of all fully performing amounts as satisfactory.\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised cost, using the\nlifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix. The behavioural matrix looks at how defaults develop\non a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the contracts. The behavioural matrix is based on historically\nobserved data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit band. This is supported by historical\nanalysis. The following table details the risk profile of trade receivables at the reporting date, based on the Group’s provision matrix.\nTrade receivables – days past due\nMore than\n31 – 60 days 61 – 90 days 91 – 120 days 120 days\nCurrent past due past due past due past due Total\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nAs at 3 July 2022\nGross carrying amount 1 703 324 76 34 169 2 306\nLifetime ECL (40) (3) (7) (20) (94) (164)\nNet carrying amount 1 663 321 69 14 75 2 142\nExpected credit loss rate 2.3% 0.9% 9.2% 58.8% 55.6% 7.1%\nAs at 4 July 2021\nGross carrying amount 1 604 240 77 45 236 2 202\nLifetime ECL (51) (10) (5) (37) (100) (203)\nNet carrying amount 1 553 230 72 8 136 1 999\nExpected credit loss rate 3.2% 4.2% 6.5% 82.2% 42.4% 9.2%\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for trade receivables:\nAccounts not\ncredit-impaired Credit-impaired accounts\nReceivables\nBuying aid Total trade from medical Buying aid Total credit-\nsocieties receivables Receivables aid schemes, societies and impaired\nand other not credit- from pharmacies other trade Total trade\nreceivables impaired franchisees and doctors receivables receivables receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\n2022\nBalance at the beginning of the year 81 81 32 44 46 122 203\nNew financial assets originated or\npurchased during the year 36 36 10 6 19 35 71\nAmounts recovered during the year (55) (55) — (4) — (4) (59)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible (3) (3) (24) — (24) (48) (51)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — (6) (6) (6)\nForeign currency translation differences — — — — 6 6 6\nBalance at the end of the year 59 59 18 46 41 105 164\n2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year 102 102 19 31 55 105 207\nNew financial assets originated or\npurchased during the year 51 51 13 15 1 29 80\nIndividual financial assets transferred to\nnon-performing (credit-impaired financial\nassets) (2) (2) — — 2 2 —\nAmounts recovered during the year (69) (69) — (1) (1) (2) (71)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible (6) (6) — (1) (1) (2) (8)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — (4) (4) (4)\nForeign currency translation differences 5 5 — — (6) (6) (1)\nBalance at the end of the year 81 81 32 44 46 122 203\nAssumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of trade receivables in terms of the simplified approach for measuring\nimpairment are detailed below.\nTo measure ECL, trade receivables have been grouped by shared credit risk characteristics by considering the different revenue streams\nwithin each operating segment such as franchise, retail and wholesale of pharmaceutical products, furniture, travel packages and ticket\nsales through Computicket as well as by geographical location and days past due.\nECL are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables at each reporting date. The loss ratio is calculated\naccording to the ageing/payment profile of sales by applying historic/proxy write-offs to the payment profile of the sales population. In\ninstances where there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy write-off. Trade receivable balances have\nbeen grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of receivables with similar risk characteristics and ability to pay.\nSimilarly, the sales population selected to determine the ageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population\nand in line with future payment expectations.\nFor receivables from franchisees, the expected loss ratios are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last 36 months before\neach reporting period. The expected loss ratios of other trade receivables are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last\n12 months before each reporting period.\nAnnexures 103\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) continued\nThe historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward-looking information to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade receivables at the\nreporting date to the extent that there is a strong correlation between the forward-looking information and the ECL. The Group has\nperformed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment rate (both formal\nand informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected macroeconomic variables are appropriate\ndrivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of the book and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact of extrapolating the\nforward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be monitored and will be reassessed\nat each reporting date.\nOther receivables (note 13.3)\nOther receivables consist of various operational debtors such as municipal deposits refundable, insurance claims receivable and staff\ndebtors and bursaries. The age analysis of these amounts are reviewed on a monthly basis and creditworthiness assessed. If the credit\nrisk of any individual receivable is deemed to be material, the credit history of the relevant client will be verified with an external credit\nbureau.

This is due to a shortage of physical currency. These restricted cash balances held by the Group are not available for general\nuse by the holding company or other subsidiaries in the Group.\ne) Cash and cash equivalents\nThe Group uses subsidiaries of rated South African and/or international financial institutions as its bankers. However, due to the Group’s\ninternational operational requirements it is forced to transact with financial institutions in certain countries where independent\ninternationally accredited credit ratings are not available. In these instances the Group’s exposure to credit risk at each of these financial\ninstitutions are evaluated by management on a case by case basis. Cash balances deposited with these financial institutions are kept to\nan operational minimum and are transferred, subject to exchange control regulations and available suitable foreign currency, to financial\ninstitutions with acceptable credit ratings. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.\nECL of cash and cash equivalents are calculated in terms of the general model for impairment. All cash and cash equivalents were\ndetermined to be in stage 1 as the counterparties have low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows.

These local exchange control regulations impose restrictions on exporting capital\nfrom the country, other than through normal dividends. These restricted cash balances held by the respective subsidiaries are not\navailable for general use by the holding company or other subsidiaries in the Group.\n\n### 40.4.2 Market risk\na) Currency risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures. The treasury department\nhedges the Group’s net position in each foreign currency by using call deposits in foreign currencies and derivative financial instruments\nin the form of forward foreign exchange rate contracts for all cumulative foreign commitments of three months or more. Forward foreign\nexchange rate contracts are not used for speculative purposes. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for\npurposes of accounting.\nCurrency exposure arising from the net monetary assets in individual countries, held in currencies other than the functional currency of\nthe Group, are managed primarily through converting cash and cash equivalents not required for operational cash flows to US dollar,\nsubject to exchange control regulations. The US dollar is the preferred currency due to its history of stability, liquidity and availability in\nmost markets.\nShort-term loans between subsidiaries of the Group expose the Group to currency risk resulting from fluctuations in local currency\nexchange rates to the US dollar (2022: R790 million liability; 2021: R596 million liability) and South Africa rand (2022: R358 million\nliability; 2021: R844 million liability). This US dollar currency risk is mitigated by the investment in AOA, USD Index Linked, Angola\nGovernment Bonds (2022: R739 million asset; 2021: R876 million asset) (refer to note 10.1) which serves as a natural hedge against\nthe Group’s currency risk on short-term US dollar loans between Group subsidiaries.\nMaterial concentrations of currency risk also exist within the Group’s lease liabilities and net cash and cash equivalents as follows:\nLease liabilities Net cash and cash equivalents\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nForeign currency Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSouth Africa rand — — 29 56\nUnited States dollar 1 635 1 606 366 59\nNigeria naira — — — 430\nEuro — — 49 —\nOther currencies — — 1 58\n1 635 1 606 445 603\nThe Group does not have significant foreign creditors as most inventory imports are prepaid.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.2 Market risk continued\na) Currency risk continued\nHedge of net investment in foreign operation\nThe Group hedges a designated portion of its US dollar net assets in Shoprite International Ltd for foreign currency exposure arising\nbetween the US dollar and South Africa rand as part of the Group’s risk management objectives. Shoprite International Ltd has a\nUS dollar functional currency. Shoprite Holdings Ltd’s net investment in Shoprite International Ltd is therefore exposed to fluctuations in\nthe US$/ZAR spot exchange rate. Shoprite International Ltd uses these dollars in order to fund the operations in the various countries\noutside of South Africa, which also have liabilities denominated in US dollar. As a result of this exposure, the Group designates external\nlease liabilities denominated in US dollar as hedging instruments. Foreign exchange movements on translation of these hedging\ninstruments are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FCTR within shareholders’ equity for the duration of\nthe hedging relationship, offsetting the exchange rate differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on translation of\nthe designated US dollar net assets of Shoprite International Ltd to South Africa rand. The cumulative foreign exchange movement\nrecognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon loss of control, joint control or significant\ninfluence due to the disposal or abandonment of Shoprite International Ltd. The hedging relationship is reset on a monthly basis,\nwhereby the designated portion of the net investment is adjusted to equal the value of the hedging instruments.\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedging relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness\nassessments, by comparing the changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with\nchanges in the net assets designated in Shoprite International Ltd. Hedge ineffectiveness could arise due to a decrease in the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation to a level below that of the designated lease liabilities. No hedge ineffectiveness was recognised in the\nstatement of comprehensive income.\nThe effects of the foreign currency-related hedging instruments on the Group’s financial position and performance are as follows:\n2022 2021\nUS$m US$m\nNominal amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 78 88\nNominal amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (current liabilities) 22 16\nNominal amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities included in liabilities directly associated\nwith assets classified as held for sale (current liabilities) — 7\nRm Rm\nCarrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (non-current liabilities) 1 268 1 281\nCarrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities (current liabilities) 367 225\nCarrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities included in liabilities directly associated\nwith assets classified as held for sale (current liabilities) — 100\nTotal carrying amount of US dollar denominated lease liabilities 1 635 1 606\nChange in carrying amount of designated lease liabilities as a result of foreign currency losses 137 (207)\nChange in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness (137) 207\nHedge ratio 100% 100%\nReconciliation of amounts accumulated in the FCTR relating to hedges of net investments in\nforeign operations:\nBalance at the beginning of the year (469) (310)\nChange in carrying amount of hedging instruments as a result of foreign currency losses\nrecognised in other comprehensive income, net of income tax (note 17.1.2) 62 (159)\nBalance at the end of the year (407) (469)\nAnnexures 107\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.2 Market risk continued\na) Currency risk continued\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of currency risk\nWhere material concentrations of currency risk exist within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to calculate what the\nincrease/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual currencies strengthened or weakened against the South\nAfrica rand and the US dollar. At 3 July 2022, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency\nmovements, was R60 million with the Zambia kwacha exchange rate to the US dollar and South Africa rand (with an expected decline\nof 4.5% against the US dollar and 10.6% against the South Africa rand) contributing R22 million and R6 million respectively to this\nnumber. At 4 July 2021, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was\nR73 million with the Zambia kwacha exchange rate to the US dollar and South Africa rand (with an expected decline of 4.1% against\nthe US dollar and 4.7% against the South Africa rand) contributing R29 million and R4 million respectively to this number. These\nchanges had no material effect on the Group’s equity.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments, exposed to currency risk at the reporting date and does not\nreflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to the self funding nature of\nthe Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of merchandise and payments to trade and\nother payables. The possible currency movements were determined based on management’s best estimates taking into account\nprevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nThe Group has a number of investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.\nAlthough not subject to market risk, the following constituted significant concentrations of net monetary assets/(liabilities), including\nshort-term surplus funds, in currencies other than the reporting currency as at the reporting date, subject to translation risk.\n2022 2021\nForeign currency Rm Rm\nAngola kwanza 1 176 1 874\nUnited States dollar 2 154 (1 429)\nb) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from daily call accounts, bank overdrafts and borrowings. The Group does not account for\nany fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date\nwould not affect profit or loss. Fixed rate financial instruments include government bonds and bills (refer to note 10), loans receivable\n(refer to note 11), and instalment sale receivables (refer to note 13.2).\nDaily call accounts and bank overdrafts carry interest at rates fixed on a daily basis and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.\nThe Group analyses this interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Daily cash flow forecasts are done and combined with interest rates\nquoted on a daily basis. This information is then taken into consideration when reviewing refinancing/reinvesting and/or renewal/\ncancellation of existing positions and alternative financing/investing. Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on\nprofit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. The scenarios are run only for cash/borrowings that represent the major interest-bearing\npositions. The weighted average effective interest rate on call accounts was 4.6% (2021: 4.3%).\nAs part of the process of managing floating rate interest-bearing debt, the interest rate characteristics of borrowings (refer to note 19)\nare positioned according to the expected movements in interest rates. Interest rate profiles are analysed by the changes in borrowing\nlevels and the interest rates applicable to the facilities available to the Group. The Chief Financial Officer has the mandate to approve the\nuse of fixed interest debt and interest rate swaps as circumstances dictate. No interest rate swaps were entered into during the current\nyear.\nExposure to interest rate risk on other monetary items consists of amounts receivable from franchisees (note 11.2).\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of interest rate risk\nWhere material concentrations of interest rate risk exists within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to calculate what the\nincrease/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual interest rates the Group’s financial instruments are\nsubject to strengthened or weakened. At 3 July 2022, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated\ninterest rate movements, was R61 million. The estimated increase of 175 basis points in the South African prime rate would have\nresulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R52 million. At 4 July 2021, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax\nprofit, calculated for all estimated interest rate movements, was R14 million. The estimated decrease of 45 basis points in the South\nAfrican prime rate would have resulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R14 million. These changes had no material\neffect on the Group’s equity.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk at the reporting date and does not\nreflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to the self funding nature of\nthe Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of merchandise and payments to trade and\nother payables. The possible interest rate movements were determined based on management’s best estimates taking into account\nprevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\n### 40.4.3 Liquidity risk\nThe risk of illiquidity is managed by using cash flow forecasts, maintaining adequate unutilised banking facilities (2022: R6.5 billion;\n2021: R10.4 billion) and unlimited borrowing powers. All unutilised facilities are controlled by the Group’s treasury department in accordance\nwith a treasury mandate as approved by the Board of Directors.\nUnder the terms of the major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenants, calculated on the\nbasis that IAS 17: Leases is still applied:\n• The leverage ratio (net debt to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)) must not exceed\n2.75 times;\n• The net finance costs cover ratio (EBITDA divided by net finance costs) must be a minimum of 3.5 times; and\n• The finance costs cover ratio (EBITDA divided by finance costs) must be a minimum of 3.5 times.\nThe Group has complied with these covenants throughout the reporting period. As at the reporting date, these ratio’s measured as follows:\n2022 2021\ntimes times\n– Leverage (0.02) (0.22)\n– Net finance costs cover 21.72 18.29\n– Finance costs cover 91.27 10.44\nThe following table analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period, at\nthe reporting date, to the contractual maturity date.

The insurance risk relates to the risk\nthat there will be insufficient capital available to honour the claims made by the policyholders in the insurance cell captive arrangements.\nThe risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that an insured event occurs as well as the uncertainty of the amount of the\nresulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and unpredictable.\nUnderwriting risk is the risk that the Group’s actual exposure to short-term risks in respect of policy-holding benefits will exceed prudent\nestimates. Where appropriate, the above risks are managed by senior management and Directors.\nWithin the insurance process, concentration risk may arise where a particular event or series of events could impact heavily on the Group’s\nresources. The Group has not formally monitored the concentration risk; however, it has mitigated against concentration risk by structuring\nevent limits in every policy to ensure that the probability of underwriting loss is minimised. Therefore, the Group does not consider its\nconcentration risk to be high.",

The hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Measurements in whole or in part are done by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and\nliabilities. Quoted prices are readily available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency\nand those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.\nLevel 2: Measurements are done by reference to inputs other than quoted prices that are included in level 1. These inputs are observable\nfor the financial instrument, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. from derived prices).\nLevel 3: Measurements are done by reference to inputs that are not based on observable market data.\nThe Group’s investment in Centriq Insurance Company Ltd first-party cell captive insurance arrangements are measured at fair value and\nclassified at level 3 (refer to 9.2). The fair value is based on the net asset value of the insurance cells at the statement of financial\nnote\nposition date. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.\nAll other financial instruments held by the Group are measured at amortised cost. The fair value of these financial instruments is calculated\nusing cash flows discounted at a rate based on the market related borrowings rate as indicated.\nThe following tables reflect the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy, at\nthe reporting date. It does not include inputs used to determine the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair\nvalue of financial instruments classified at level 3.

        "text": "40.4.1 Credit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting\nin financial loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.\nPotential concentration of credit risk consists primarily of investment in insurance cell captive arrangements, government bonds and bills,\nloans receivable, trade and other receivables, restricted cash as well as cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following impairment losses, including reversals of impairment losses, in relation to financial assets are presented as credit impairment\nlosses in the statement of comprehensive income:\n2022 2021\nRm Rm\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) 120 62\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) 6 5\nGovernment bonds and bills (note 10) (35) 17\nLoans receivable (note 11) 120 174\nOther receivables (note 13.3) (38) (36)\nNet impairment losses on financial assets 173 222\nOf the previously mentioned impairment losses, R126 million (2021: R67 million) relate to receivables arising from contracts with customers.\nThe Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the ECL model. The inputs, assumptions and\nestimation techniques used in measuring ECL are explained below.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the general model for impairment\nECL are measured on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has occurred\nsince initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. ECL are the discounted product of the probability of default\n(PD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n• The PD represents the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its financial obligation, either over 12 months (12-month PD) or over\nthe remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.\n• The EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default over the next 12 months (12-month EAD) or\nover the remaining lifetime (lifetime EAD).\n• The Group calculates loss given default (LGD) as discounted EAD.\nThese three components are multiplied together. This effectively calculates the ECL which is then discounted back to the reporting date,\nusing the original effective interest rate, and aggregated. ECL is a probability-weighted outcome.\nThe 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the PD, which varies by type of financial asset.\nSICR in terms of the general model for impairment\nThe Group considers financial assets subject to assessment for ECL in terms of the general model for impairment, to have experienced a\nSICR since the time of initial recognition, when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or backstop criteria have been met.\nThe SICR assessment happens on a bi-annual basis per financial asset class, at a portfolio level. The criteria used to identify SICR are\nmonitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the credit risk team.\nQuantitative criteria\nWhere the counterparty has not met its minimum contractual obligations for at least one month.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nQualitative criteria\nThe Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Especially the following indicators are incorporated:\n•\nInternal and external credit ratings;\n• Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant\nchange to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;\n• Changes in general economic and/or market conditions;\n• Changes in the amount of financial support available to the counterparty;\n• Expected or potential breaches of covenants; and\n• Expected delay in payment.\nA backstop is applied if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the simplified model\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified model and measures the impairment allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. This\npolicy has been applied to all instalment sale and net investment in lease receivables. Lifetime ECL are assessed by determining cash flows\non a probability-weighted basis and discounting these at the effective interest rate including initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the following:\n• Transition matrix and conditional probabilities; and\n•\nPayment performance for each payment state.\nMeasurement of ECL in terms of the provision matrix\nFor short-term trade receivables, e.g. trade receivables without a significant financing component, the determination of forward-looking\neconomic scenarios may be less significant given that over the credit risk exposure period a significant change in economic conditions may\nbe unlikely, and historical loss rates might be an appropriate basis for the estimate of expected future losses. The Group has elected to\napply the provision matrix for trade receivables without a significant financing component and measures the impairment allowance at an\namount equal to lifetime ECL. Lifetime ECL are assessed by applying the relevant loss rates to the trade receivable balances outstanding\n(i.e. a trade receivable age analysis). Due to the diversity of the Group’s customer base, the Group used appropriate groupings if the\nhistorical credit loss experience showed significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.\nDefinition of default and credit-impaired assets\nThe Group defines a financial instrument as in default when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 90 days of when\nthey fall due. This is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired assets.\nWith regard to credit-impaired accounts, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost, i.e.\ngross carrying amount less impairment provision, resulting in lower interest revenue.\nThe criteria for credit-impaired accounts (i.e. when the account moves to stage 3 as a result of loss events that have occurred after initial\nrecognition) are as follows:\nReceivables arising from contracts with customers:\n• In duplum (the National Credit Act section providing that all charges ceases to accrue once the sum of the charges equals the amount\nof capital outstanding at the time);\n• Debt counselling accounts (as governed by the National Credit Act);\n• Non-performing accounts; and\n• As a backstop, accounts not included in the above categories, where no payment has been received over the last three consecutive\nmonths.\nGovernment bonds and bills and loans receivable:\n• Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty;\n• Where a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations; and\n• The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.\nOther receivables:\nWhere a counterparty has not met their minimum contractual obligations for three consecutive months.\nAnnexures 93\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nCuring\nA credit-impaired account will cure when the customer does not meet the criteria for being a credit-impaired account. For a customer to\ncure, a significant improvement in the customer’s payment behaviour is required. Curing occurs in the following instances:\nGovernment bonds and bills:\nWhen the outlook on the Angolan economy, according to major rating agencies, improves from negative to being stable or positive.\nThis typically happens when the external credit rating improves from initial recognition or the previous reporting period from a rating below\nBBB- to a rating between AAA and BBB-.\nLoans receivable:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of payment. If a loan receivable was\ndetermined to be credit-impaired, based on the significant difficulty of the counterparty, it will cure once there is clear evidence of financial\nstability from the counterparty.\nInstalment sale receivables:\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of payment.\n• Accounts in debt counselling will cure when the customer is no longer in debt counselling in terms of the requirements of the National\nCredit Act.\n• Non-performing accounts will only cure when their lifetime payment rating improves to the extent that the customer has paid 55% or\nmore of the amounts due over the contract period. Generally, this will require a significant improvement in the customer’s payment\nbehaviour.\nTrade receivables:\n• In duplum accounts will cure when they no longer meet the requirements of the National Credit Act for being defined as an in duplum\naccount.\n• Where no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nOther receivables:\nWhere no payment has been received in the last three consecutive months, it will cure once in receipt of a payment.\nWrite-off policy\nThe Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there\nis no reasonable expectation of recovery. This is usually the case when the Group’s in-house collection department and external collection\ncompanies which supplement the Group’s collection activities are unable to recover outstanding balances.\na) Government bonds and bills (note 10)\nThe Group invests in Angola government bonds and treasury bills as part of its hedging strategy against a future foreign exchange\ndevaluation in Angola. The majority of the government bonds are linked to the US dollar, which provides a natural hedge against\nUS dollar short-term intergroup loans payable by the Group’s subsidiaries in Angola, while the remaining government bonds and bills\nprovide high returns.\nNone of the government bonds and bills are past due. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.\nThe table below reflects the maximum exposure to credit risk on government bonds and bills at the reporting date.\n2022 2021\nBasis for\nInternal recognition Gross ECL Carrying Gross ECL Carrying\ncredit rating of ECL ECL amount allowance amount ECL amount allowance amount\ncategory allowance Financial instrument class rate Rm Rm Rm rate Rm Rm Rm\nUnder­ Lifetime AOA, USD Index\nperforming ECL Linked, Angola\n(stage 2) Government Bonds 4.8% 776 (37) 739 3.9% 912 (36) 876\nAOA, Angola\nGovernment Bonds 5.4% 632 (34) 598 4.9% 589 (29) 560\nAngola Treasury Bills 0.0% — — — 6.5% 62 (4) 58\nTotal government bonds and bills 1 408 (71) 1 337 1 563 (69) 1 494\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\na) Government bonds and bills (note 10) continued\nInternal credit rating categories are defined as follows with reference to external credit ratings published by Standard & Poor’s for Angola:\n• Performing (stage 1): Counterparty has a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows based on\nexternal credit ratings ranging between AAA and A+.\n• Underperforming (stage 2): Investments for which there is a SICR.

The underlying PD (including their term structure) used to construct the\nestimates of PD are sourced from Moody’s publications of historical default ratings for sovereign debt and no adjustments are made to\nthese historical PD.\nIt is assumed that Angola will have a through-the-cycle (TTC) performance and therefore the Group made no macroeconomic\nadjustment to the ECL allowance for government bonds and bills. A flat LGD assumption of 40% was applied across all bonds and\ntime periods. This is in line with historical statistics that are available from Moody’s publications for comparable instruments. The PD\ncurves are built on the credit ratings published by Standard & Poor’s for Angola.\nAnnexures 95\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nb) Loans receivable (note 11)\nThe Group provides financing to trading partners, such as franchisees and certain landlords in countries outside South Africa to enable\nthe Group to secure strategic sites as anchor tenant.

The Group manages its credit risk by holding share pledges and cession agreements in\nthe underlying subsidiaries of Resilient Africa (Pty) Ltd as collateral for the US dollar denominated loan receivable (refer to note 11.1.2).\nCircle Mall Mauritius Ltd’s holding company provided a guarantee and indemnity for 50% of the loan amount which is in turn secured by\na pledge of 100% of the shareholding in Circle Mall Mauritius Ltd to the Group (refer to note 11.3).\nKin Oasis Investments Ltd’s holding company, Kinois Investments Ltd, provided a guarantee and indemnity for 100% of all present and\nfuture payment obligations and liabilities which is in turn secured by a pledge of 60% of the shareholding in Kin Oasis Investments Ltd\nto the Group (refer to note 11.4).\nAmounts receivable from franchisees relate to a wide-spread number of franchisees which are individually insignificant.

Global Corporate Average Cumulative Default Rates With Rating Modifiers\n(1981 – 2021) (%) as published on 13 April 2022 by Standard and Poor’s for corporate exposures are used as input to these\ncalculations. The rating is then adjusted to represent the appropriate risk appetite for a specific instrument.\nThe Group has performed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment rate (both formal\nand informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rate.\nc) Trade and other receivables\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2)\nInstalment sale receivables comprise a wide-spread client base and external credit checks are made to ensure that all instalment sale\nclients have an appropriate credit history.\nThe Group’s instalment sale receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary\ncourse of business. These receivables contain a significant financing component with terms of business varying from 12 to 36 months.\nThe Group has developed advanced credit-granting systems to properly assess the creditworthiness of its customers.\nCredit granting:\nThe credit underwriting process flows through the following stages:\n(i) Credit scoring: This involves the gathering of appropriate information from the client, use of credit bureaus and third parties such\nas employers. These input variables are run through the various credit scorecards. In assessing applications for credit, strict\naffordability criteria are applied together with in-house developed scorecards based on credit bureau data. Industry-wide fraud\ndetection tools are used to identify potentially fraudulent applications. The Group deals with its new customers and existing\ncustomers differently when credit scoring takes place.\nCustomer acquisition takes into account the risk level, repurchase propensity and profitability of new customers. Behaviour\nscorecards are used to determine credit extension to customers in good standing, to drive repurchase rates and repeat loans, and\nreduce average bad debt. These scorecards are regularly reviewed and upgraded to ensure the Group’s credit policy remains in line\nwith an acceptable level of risk for repeat business.\nAnnexures 97\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\n(ii) Assessing client affordability: This process involves collecting information regarding the customer’s income levels, expenses and\ncurrent debt obligations. The Group has its own priority expense model based on surveys conducted with customers in addition to\nthe National Credit Regulator’s expense table. The following factors are then taken into consideration to conclude on the affordability\nof each customer:\n• Assessing existing financial means and prospects;\n• Assessing existing financial obligations;\n• Assessing debt repayment history; and\n• Ignoring credit agreements that will be substituted.\nThe total cost of credit is disclosed to the consumer.\n(iii) Determining the credit limit for the customer: The customer’s risk score determined by the scorecard together with the\nexpense assessment and outstanding obligations are used to calculate a credit limit within the customer’s affordability level.\nThe credit granting systems enable the Group to determine its appetite for risk. In determining the acceptable level of risk, the potential\nloss is weighed up against the revenue potential using the predictive behavioural models inherent in the credit-granting system. The\nGroup monitors any variances from the level of risk that has been adopted and adjusts the credit-granting process on a regular basis.\nThe Group manages its risk effectively by assessing the customer’s ability to service the proposed monthly instalment.\nContractual arrears:\nContractual arrears are calculated by reference to the actual arrears in terms of the original signed agreement. The key aspect of the\narrear calculation is the Group’s policy not to reschedule arrears nor to amend the terms of the original contract.\nFrom the onset of the agreement, contractual arrears are calculated by comparing payments made life to date with the originally\ncalculated instalments due life to date, causing a customer who is paying less than the required contracted instalment to immediately\nfall into arrears. Once the customer exceeds the term of the agreement by paying less than the required contracted instalments, the full\nbalance owing will be in arrears. The Group does not consider arrears the leading indicator, but rather payment ratings for the reasons\nmentioned above.\nThe tables below reflect the maximum exposure to credit risk on instalment sale receivables as well as the ECL allowance and\ncontractual arrears per customer grouping at the reporting date. Customer groupings are determined as follows:\n• Satisfactory paid: Customers who have paid 70% or more of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Slow payers: Customers who have paid 55% to 69% of amounts due over the contract period.\n• Non-performing accounts: Customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 3 July 2022\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 94 408 824 193 23.4% 59 26 15 18\n38.4% 43.2% 22.7%\nSlow payers 31 314 274 135 49.3% 71 14 14 43\n12.7% 14.4% 15.8%\nNon-performing accounts 120 258 809 524 64.8% 373 15 17 341\n48.9% 42.4% 61.5%\nTotal instalment sale\nreceivables 245 980 1 907 852 44.7% 503 55 46 402\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 3 July 2022 included in the table above\nNo payment in 3\nIn duplum Debt counselling consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\naccounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\nCredit-impaired categories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying amount 809 10 90 9 13 14 30 975\nECL allowance (524) (3) (40) (2) (7) (4) (7) (587)\nAmortised cost 285 7 50 7 6 10 23 388\nAnalysis of instalment sale receivables at 4 July 2021\nNumber of instalments in arrears\nGross\nTotal carrying ECL ECL Total 1 2 >2\nnumber of amount allowance allowance arrears instalment instalments instalments\nCustomer grouping customers Rm Rm % Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSatisfactory paid 133 061 750 173 23.1% 179 67 39 73\n55.1% 44.9% 22.6%\nSlow payers 30 993 238 104 43.7% 56 8 7 41\n12.8% 14.3% 13.6%\nNon-performing accounts 77 380 678 488 72.0% 164 6 4 154\n32.1% 40.7% 63.8%\nTotal instalment sale\nreceivables 241 434 1 666 765 45.9% 399 81 50 268\nAnalysis of credit-impaired instalment sale receivables at 4 July 2021 included in the table above\nNo payment in 3\nIn duplum Debt counselling consecutive months\nNon-\nperforming Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow Satisfactory Slow\naccounts paid payers paid payers paid payers Total\nCredit-impaired categories Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nGross carrying amount 678 11 66 11 7 10 23 806\nECL allowance (488) (3) (30) (2) (4) (4) (5) (536)\nAmortised cost 190 8 36 9 3 6 18 270\nAnnexures 99\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for instalment sale receivables:\n2022 2021\nTotal Total\nAccounts Credit- instalment Accounts Credit- instalment\nnot credit- impaired sale not credit- impaired sale\nimpaired accounts receivables impaired accounts receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nBalance at the beginning of the year 229 536 765 231 587 818\nNew financial assets originated or purchased during\nthe year 140 64 204 131 56 187\nIndividual financial assets transferred to non-performing\n(credit-impaired financial assets) (148) 148 — (128) 128 —\nAmounts recovered during the year — (115) (115) — (117) (117)\nChanges in risk parameters 34 (3) 31 6 (14) (8)\nAmounts written off during the year as uncollectible — (63) (63) — (82) (82)\nForeign currency translation differences 10 20 30 (11) (22) (33)\nBalance at the end of the year 265 587 852 229 536 765\nSpecific assumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of instalment sale receivables in terms of the simplified\napproach for impairment are detailed below.\nProbability-weighted cash flows:\nThe expected credit loss is a probability-weighted estimate and represents the difference between the cash flows that are due to the\nGroup in accordance with the contract and the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate\nincluding initiation fees.\nThe probability-weighted cash flows are calculated using the debtor book population’s payment behaviour in combination with a\ntransition matrix. The transition matrix and payment performance for each payment state has been developed utilising customer\npayment history. The transition matrix predicts the population’s payment behaviour and probability of the account being in a particular\npayment state and transitioning into future payment states. The key states in the transitional matrix are the customer’s lifetime payment\nrating, age of the account and contractual term. The lifetime payment rating measures the customer’s actual payments received over\nthe lifetime of the account relative to the contractual instalments due.\nFor modelling purposes, cash flows are forecast on an individual customer level and aggregated over all the customer’s sub-accounts\nuntil the account is settled or written off. For each contractual term, lifetime payment rating and age, the transitional matrix maps the\nprobability of an account transitioning into future lifetime payment ratings for the remaining months on book.\nThe payment performance for each payment state is calculated using the actual payment history for each payment rating over the last\nfive years to ensure the recency of the impairment model as required by IFRS 9.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nInstalment sale receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.2) continued\nEconomic overlay:\nAn economic overlay has been developed by performing a regression analysis between key economic variables with reference to the\nnon-performing category over a five-year period (customers who have paid less than 55% of amounts due over the contract period).\nThe model considers a number of macroeconomic variables including gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index, prime\noverdraft rate and unemployment rate.\nIn the comparative year the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the South African consumer affected the relative probability of the\nthree scenarios, thus affecting the forward-looking economic overlay applied on the impairment provision. The provision estimates were\nadjusted to account for this expected increase in risk of missed payments or default, due to Covid-19 related financial stress inhibiting\nthe ability and prioritisation of clients to pay their debt to the Group.\nThe Group makes use of a cash flow model adjusted for coverage percentages unique to each country and each state. The process of\ndetermining adjusted coverage percentages involved applying an adjustment to the PDs. In the comparative year these PDs were\nadjusted by a scalar to account for the economic stress caused by Covid-19. The scalar was based on country-specific GDP forecasts.\nThe GDP forecasts used for South Africa are listed below. The IMF GDP forecasts were used for the other African countries.\nCalendar year\n2022 2023 2024\nScenario\nUpside 2.2% 2.0% 1.6%\nBase (4.9%) (0.7%) (0.1%)\nDownside 7.1% 3.9% 3.9%\nUpside, base and downside scenarios using the economic variables above are determined and a weighted average scenario is\nprepared. This is compared to the base position and an appropriate adjustment is made to the whole trade receivables book.\nThe three scenarios project the future impact of the economic variables on the impairment provision. Management has assigned a\nprobability of 6.0% (2021: 0.0%) to the upside scenario, 77.0% (2021: 60.0%) to the base scenario and 17.0% (2021: 40.0%) to\nthe downside scenario for the 12-month forecast for South Africa.\n2022 2021\nSouth Africa South Africa\nImpact of forward-looking information on ECL: Rm % change Rm % change\nProbability-weighted impact of all three scenarios 426 380\n100% upside scenario 407 (4.4) 352 (7.4)\n100% base scenario 413 (3.2) 372 (2.1)\n100% downside scenario 494 15.9 393 3.2\nAnnexures 101\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1)\nSales to retail customers are settled in cash or using debit and credit cards. Except for the total exposure represented by the respective\nstatement of financial position items, the Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.\nThe Group has policies in place to ensure that all sales of goods and services on credit are made to customers with an appropriate\ncredit history. Balances are due within 30 days of statement date and the age analysis of these amounts are reviewed on a monthly\nbasis. Franchisees comprise a wide-spread client base and the credit history of all franchisees are verified with an external credit\nbureau. Notarial and mortgage bonds and bank guarantees to the value of R1.3 billion (2021: R1.1 billion) are held as collateral for\nthese amounts. Long standing trading relationships exist with the buying aid societies and the Group reviews the credit history of these\nsocieties, based on its own records as well as information from an external credit bureau, on a cyclical basis. Based on this, the Group\nconsiders the credit quality of all fully performing amounts as satisfactory.\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised cost, using the\nlifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix. The behavioural matrix looks at how defaults develop\non a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the contracts. The behavioural matrix is based on historically\nobserved data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit band. This is supported by historical\nanalysis. The following table details the risk profile of trade receivables at the reporting date, based on the Group’s provision matrix.\nTrade receivables – days past due\nMore than\n31 – 60 days 61 – 90 days 91 – 120 days 120 days\nCurrent past due past due past due past due Total\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\nAs at 3 July 2022\nGross carrying amount 1 703 324 76 34 169 2 306\nLifetime ECL (40) (3) (7) (20) (94) (164)\nNet carrying amount 1 663 321 69 14 75 2 142\nExpected credit loss rate 2.3% 0.9% 9.2% 58.8% 55.6% 7.1%\nAs at 4 July 2021\nGross carrying amount 1 604 240 77 45 236 2 202\nLifetime ECL (51) (10) (5) (37) (100) (203)\nNet carrying amount 1 553 230 72 8 136 1 999\nExpected credit loss rate 3.2% 4.2% 6.5% 82.2% 42.4% 9.2%\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) continued\nReconciliation of loss allowance for trade receivables:\nAccounts not\ncredit-impaired Credit-impaired accounts\nReceivables\nBuying aid Total trade from medical Buying aid Total credit-\nsocieties receivables Receivables aid schemes, societies and impaired\nand other not credit- from pharmacies other trade Total trade\nreceivables impaired franchisees and doctors receivables receivables receivables\nRm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm Rm\n2022\nBalance at the beginning of the year 81 81 32 44 46 122 203\nNew financial assets originated or\npurchased during the year 36 36 10 6 19 35 71\nAmounts recovered during the year (55) (55) — (4) — (4) (59)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible (3) (3) (24) — (24) (48) (51)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — (6) (6) (6)\nForeign currency translation differences — — — — 6 6 6\nBalance at the end of the year 59 59 18 46 41 105 164\n2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year 102 102 19 31 55 105 207\nNew financial assets originated or\npurchased during the year 51 51 13 15 1 29 80\nIndividual financial assets transferred to\nnon-performing (credit-impaired financial\nassets) (2) (2) — — 2 2 —\nAmounts recovered during the year (69) (69) — (1) (1) (2) (71)\nAmounts written off during the year as\nuncollectible (6) (6) — (1) (1) (2) (8)\nUnused amounts reversed — — — — (4) (4) (4)\nForeign currency translation differences 5 5 — — (6) (6) (1)\nBalance at the end of the year 81 81 32 44 46 122 203\nAssumptions and judgements applied in the calculation of ECL of trade receivables in terms of the simplified approach for measuring\nimpairment are detailed below.\nTo measure ECL, trade receivables have been grouped by shared credit risk characteristics by considering the different revenue streams\nwithin each operating segment such as franchise, retail and wholesale of pharmaceutical products, furniture, travel packages and ticket\nsales through Computicket as well as by geographical location and days past due.\nECL are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables at each reporting date. The loss ratio is calculated\naccording to the ageing/payment profile of sales by applying historic/proxy write-offs to the payment profile of the sales population. In\ninstances where there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy write-off. Trade receivable balances have\nbeen grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of receivables with similar risk characteristics and ability to pay.\nSimilarly, the sales population selected to determine the ageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population\nand in line with future payment expectations.\nFor receivables from franchisees, the expected loss ratios are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last 36 months before\neach reporting period. The expected loss ratios of other trade receivables are based on the payment profiles of sales during the last\n12 months before each reporting period.\nAnnexures 103\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\nc) Trade and other receivables continued\nTrade receivables from contracts with customers (note 13.1) continued\nThe historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward-looking information to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade receivables at the\nreporting date to the extent that there is a strong correlation between the forward-looking information and the ECL. The Group has\nperformed historical analyses and identified certain macroeconomic variables correlating with credit losses.\nMacroeconomic variables used for financial assets at amortised cost include G7 real GDP growth, total unemployment rate (both formal\nand informal), prime overdraft rate, US$/ZAR exchange rate and inflation rates. The selected macroeconomic variables are appropriate\ndrivers of default rates.\nDue to the relative short-term nature of the book and constantly evolving credit criteria being applied, the impact of extrapolating the\nforward-looking information against credit variables was not material. It will, however, continue to be monitored and will be reassessed\nat each reporting date.\nOther receivables (note 13.3)\nOther receivables consist of various operational debtors such as municipal deposits refundable, insurance claims receivable and staff\ndebtors and bursaries. The age analysis of these amounts are reviewed on a monthly basis and creditworthiness assessed. If the credit\nrisk of any individual receivable is deemed to be material, the credit history of the relevant client will be verified with an external credit\nbureau.

This is due to a shortage of physical currency. These restricted cash balances held by the Group are not available for general\nuse by the holding company or other subsidiaries in the Group.\ne) Cash and cash equivalents\nThe Group uses subsidiaries of rated South African and/or international financial institutions as its bankers. However, due to the Group’s\ninternational operational requirements it is forced to transact with financial institutions in certain countries where independent\ninternationally accredited credit ratings are not available. In these instances the Group’s exposure to credit risk at each of these financial\ninstitutions are evaluated by management on a case by case basis. Cash balances deposited with these financial institutions are kept to\nan operational minimum and are transferred, subject to exchange control regulations and available suitable foreign currency, to financial\ninstitutions with acceptable credit ratings. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.\nECL of cash and cash equivalents are calculated in terms of the general model for impairment. All cash and cash equivalents were\ndetermined to be in stage 1 as the counterparties have low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows. There\nwas no SICR of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents. ECL were therefore limited to 12-month expected losses and the identified\nimpairment loss was immaterial.\nAnnexures 105\ndeclarations and reports financial statements financial statements\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.1 Credit risk continued\ne) Cash and cash equivalents continued\nThe table below shows the cash invested at the reporting date at financial institutions grouped per Moody’s short-term credit rating of\nthe financial institutions.\n2022 2021\nNational Global\nScale Scale Rm Rm\nStandard Chartered Bank P-1 1 214 1 074\nCitibank P-1 26 40\nStandard Bank P-1 NP 5 274 3 045\nABSA P-1 NP 1 468 1 247\nNedbank P-1 NP 796 1 077\nFirstRand P-1 NP 549 447\nInvestec P-1 NP — 2\nOther banks 225 147\nCash on hand and in transit 1 113 871\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 10 665 7 950\nLocal currency cash and short-term deposits of R1.2 billion (2021: R810 million) are held in Angola (2021: Angola and Nigeria) and are\nsubject to onerous local exchange control regulations.

The treasury department\nhedges the Group’s net position in each foreign currency by using call deposits in foreign currencies and derivative financial instruments\nin the form of forward foreign exchange rate contracts for all cumulative foreign commitments of three months or more. Forward foreign\nexchange rate contracts are not used for speculative purposes. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for\npurposes of accounting.\nCurrency exposure arising from the net monetary assets in individual countries, held in currencies other than the functional currency of\nthe Group, are managed primarily through converting cash and cash equivalents not required for operational cash flows to US dollar,\nsubject to exchange control regulations. The US dollar is the preferred currency due to its history of stability, liquidity and availability in\nmost markets.\nShort-term loans between subsidiaries of the Group expose the Group to currency risk resulting from fluctuations in local currency\nexchange rates to the US dollar (2022: R790 million liability; 2021: R596 million liability) and South Africa rand (2022: R358 million\nliability; 2021: R844 million liability). This US dollar currency risk is mitigated by the investment in AOA, USD Index Linked, Angola\nGovernment Bonds (2022: R739 million asset; 2021: R876 million asset) (refer to note 10.1) which serves as a natural hedge against\nthe Group’s currency risk on short-term US dollar loans between Group subsidiaries.\nMaterial concentrations of currency risk also exist within the Group’s lease liabilities and net cash and cash equivalents as follows:\nLease liabilities Net cash and cash equivalents\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nForeign currency Rm Rm Rm Rm\nSouth Africa rand — — 29 56\nUnited States dollar 1 635 1 606 366 59\nNigeria naira — — — 430\nEuro — — 49 —\nOther currencies — — 1 58\n1 635 1 606 445 603\nThe Group does not have significant foreign creditors as most inventory imports are prepaid.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n40.4.2 Market risk continued\na) Currency risk continued\nHedge of net investment in foreign operation\nThe Group hedges a designated portion of its US dollar net assets in Shoprite International Ltd for foreign currency exposure arising\nbetween the US dollar and South Africa rand as part of the Group’s risk management objectives. Shoprite International Ltd has a\nUS dollar functional currency. Shoprite Holdings Ltd’s net investment in Shoprite International Ltd is therefore exposed to fluctuations in\nthe US$/ZAR spot exchange rate. Shoprite International Ltd uses these dollars in order to fund the operations in the various countries\noutside of South Africa, which also have liabilities denominated in US dollar. As a result of this exposure, the Group designates external\nlease liabilities denominated in US dollar as hedging instruments. Foreign exchange movements on translation of these hedging\ninstruments are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FCTR within shareholders’ equity for the duration of\nthe hedging relationship, offsetting the exchange rate differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on translation of\nthe designated US dollar net assets of Shoprite International Ltd to South Africa rand. The cumulative foreign exchange movement\nrecognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon loss of control, joint control or significant\ninfluence due to the disposal or abandonment of Shoprite International Ltd. The hedging relationship is reset on a monthly basis,\nwhereby the designated portion of the net investment is adjusted to equal the value of the hedging instruments.\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedging relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness\nassessments, by comparing the changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with\nchanges in the net assets designated in Shoprite International Ltd. Hedge ineffectiveness could arise due to a decrease in the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation to a level below that of the designated lease liabilities.

At 3 July 2022, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency\nmovements, was R60 million with the Zambia kwacha exchange rate to the US dollar and South Africa rand (with an expected decline\nof 4.5% against the US dollar and 10.6% against the South Africa rand) contributing R22 million and R6 million respectively to this\nnumber. At 4 July 2021, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated currency movements, was\nR73 million with the Zambia kwacha exchange rate to the US dollar and South Africa rand (with an expected decline of 4.1% against\nthe US dollar and 4.7% against the South Africa rand) contributing R29 million and R4 million respectively to this number. These\nchanges had no material effect on the Group’s equity.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments, exposed to currency risk at the reporting date and does not\nreflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to the self funding nature of\nthe Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of merchandise and payments to trade and\nother payables. The possible currency movements were determined based on management’s best estimates taking into account\nprevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nThe Group has a number of investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.\nAlthough not subject to market risk, the following constituted significant concentrations of net monetary assets/(liabilities), including\nshort-term surplus funds, in currencies other than the reporting currency as at the reporting date, subject to translation risk.\n2022 2021\nForeign currency Rm Rm\nAngola kwanza 1 176 1 874\nUnited States dollar 2 154 (1 429)\nb) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from daily call accounts, bank overdrafts and borrowings. The Group does not account for\nany fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date\nwould not affect profit or loss. Fixed rate financial instruments include government bonds and bills (refer to note 10), loans receivable\n(refer to note 11), and instalment sale receivables (refer to note 13.2).\nDaily call accounts and bank overdrafts carry interest at rates fixed on a daily basis and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.\nThe Group analyses this interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Daily cash flow forecasts are done and combined with interest rates\nquoted on a daily basis. This information is then taken into consideration when reviewing refinancing/reinvesting and/or renewal/\ncancellation of existing positions and alternative financing/investing. Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on\nprofit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. The scenarios are run only for cash/borrowings that represent the major interest-bearing\npositions. The weighted average effective interest rate on call accounts was 4.6% (2021: 4.3%).\nAs part of the process of managing floating rate interest-bearing debt, the interest rate characteristics of borrowings (refer to note 19)\nare positioned according to the expected movements in interest rates. Interest rate profiles are analysed by the changes in borrowing\nlevels and the interest rates applicable to the facilities available to the Group. The Chief Financial Officer has the mandate to approve the\nuse of fixed interest debt and interest rate swaps as circumstances dictate. No interest rate swaps were entered into during the current\nyear.\nExposure to interest rate risk on other monetary items consists of amounts receivable from franchisees (note 11.2).\nSensitivity analysis of material concentrations of interest rate risk\nWhere material concentrations of interest rate risk exists within the Group, a sensitivity analysis was performed to calculate what the\nincrease/decrease in profit for the year would have been if the various individual interest rates the Group’s financial instruments are\nsubject to strengthened or weakened. At 3 July 2022, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax profit, calculated for all estimated\ninterest rate movements, was R61 million. The estimated increase of 175 basis points in the South African prime rate would have\nresulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R52 million. At 4 July 2021, the total possible decrease in Group post-tax\nprofit, calculated for all estimated interest rate movements, was R14 million. The estimated decrease of 45 basis points in the South\nAfrican prime rate would have resulted in a possible decrease in Group post-tax profit of R14 million. These changes had no material\neffect on the Group’s equity.\nThe amounts were calculated with reference to the financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk at the reporting date and does not\nreflect the Group’s exposure throughout the reporting period, as these balances may vary significantly due to the self funding nature of\nthe Group’s required working capital and cyclical nature of cash received from the sale of merchandise and payments to trade and\nother payables. The possible interest rate movements were determined based on management’s best estimates taking into account\nprevailing economic and market conditions and future expectations.\nNotes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued\nShoprite Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries for the year ended 3 July 2022\n40.4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED",

The insurance risk relates to the risk\nthat there will be insufficient capital available to honour the claims made by the policyholders in the insurance cell captive arrangements.\nThe risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that an insured event occurs as well as the uncertainty of the amount of the\nresulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and unpredictable.\nUnderwriting risk is the risk that the Group’s actual exposure to short-term risks in respect of policy-holding benefits will exceed prudent\nestimates. Where appropriate, the above risks are managed by senior management and Directors.\nWithin the insurance process, concentration risk may arise where a particular event or series of events could impact heavily on the Group’s\nresources. The Group has not formally monitored the concentration risk; however, it has mitigated against concentration risk by structuring\nevent limits in every policy to ensure that the probability of underwriting loss is minimised. Therefore, the Group does not consider its\nconcentration risk to be high.",

The Group’s Durban based KwaZulu-Natal fresh foods distribution centre was\npartially looted and the Pietermaritzburg Furniture distribution centre incurred fire damage. As a result of this direct impact, the Group took\nprecautionary measures which included the closing of a considerable number of stores operating in the KwaZulu-Natal province and in its\ncentral Gauteng region during that same week. All of these stores that were closed on a precautionary basis have since re-opened, as has\nthe Durban based distribution centre. This event resulted in 231 stores being impacted of which 177 have been classified as looted and 54\nas having fire damage. At the reporting date, 166 of the 177 looted stores and 28 of the 54 fire damaged stores, have since re-opened.\nThe decision was made that 10 stores will not be re-opened.
